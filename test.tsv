did really belong , afforded her no equals . The Woodhouses were first in consequence there . All looked up to them . She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day . It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . His spirits required support . He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind . Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being	l
thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband . He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London . He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square . It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time . Mr . Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after " poor Isabella " and her children were answered most satisfactorily . When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , " It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk ." " Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful	l
told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body . " Emma knows I never flatter her ," said Mr . Knightley , " but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer ." " Well ," said Emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day ." " Dear Emma bears every thing so well ," said her father	l
papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people . It is the greatest amusement in the world ! And after such success , you know !-- Every body said that Mr . Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no ! Mr . Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful -- Mr . Weston need not spend a single	s
Knightley , laughing , " and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself ." CHAPTER II Mr . Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into	s
for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might	s
Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it . CHAPTER III Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . He had not	s
former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .	l
her kind designs . Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ' s being exactly the young friend	s
was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr . Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs . Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care	s
have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs . Martin talks of taking a boy another year ." " I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . The misfortune of your birth ought to make you	s
two nearer gentility ." " To be sure ," said Harriet , in a mortified voice , " he is not so genteel as real gentlemen ." " I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin . At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men . I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with	s
in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma ' s friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . They will read together . She means it , I know ." " Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course	l
do any thing I wished ." " There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,"-- said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . " But I ," he soon added , " who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember . Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . She inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ." " I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have	l
half done about Harriet Smith . I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have . She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing . She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . Her ignorance is hourly flattery . How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance . Hartfield will	s
So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ." " She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ." " There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ," said Mrs . Weston , " as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account . I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state , I assure you ." Part of her	l
fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for . She was quite convinced of Mr . Elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . She had no scruple with regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ' s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . " You have given Miss Smith all that she required ," said he ; " you have made her graceful and	l
possession a good picture of her would be ! I would give any money for it . I almost long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust . But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me . It would be	s
be drawn ?'" " Oh ! yes , I observed it , I assure you . It was not lost on me . But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded ." Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn . She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the	l
four children ;-- there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever	s
. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . It	s
people ." " My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me ." " I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . Emma will be happy to entertain you . And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ." " You cannot do better , sir ." " I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr . Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long	s
and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ." " Pray , Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?" " Certainly ," replied he , surprized , " I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ?" " Come ," said she , " I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ." This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr . Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , " Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ?" " Oh ! to be sure ," cried Emma , " it is always incomprehensible to a man that a	l
only as parlour - boarder at a common school . She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account ,	s
woman for you . And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ? No -- pray let her have time to look about her ." " I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet . You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of	l
Mrs . Goddard ' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master ' s son ." " We think so very differently on this point , Mr . Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it . We shall only be making each other more angry . But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application . She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do . His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not	l
now . I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable . But the case is altered now . She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet ." " Nonsense ,	s
errant nonsense , as ever was talked !" cried Mr . Knightley .--" Robert Martin ' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ." Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma ' s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer . He was thinking . The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . " Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but	l
Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . He knows the value of a good income as well as any body . Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally . He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s . He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away . I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece ." " I am very much obliged to you ," said Emma , laughing again . " If I had set my heart on Mr . Elton ' s marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want	l
club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr . Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr . Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . Mr . Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr . Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits . Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she	l
that she was not forgiven . She was sorry , but could not repent . On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr . Elton ' s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet ' s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr . Martin ' s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr . Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend ' s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to -	l
Smith could inspire him ." The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . " I do not offer it for Miss Smith ' s collection ," said he . " Being my friend ' s , I	s
happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good . It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of	s
If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it ." " I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ." " I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read ." " I never read one more to the purpose , certainly ." " It is as long again as almost all we have had before ." " I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour . Such things in general cannot be too short ."	s
room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know . Why should there be any change ?" " I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here !-- not since last Easter , and then only for a few days .-- Mr . John Knightley ' s being a lawyer is very inconvenient .-- Poor Isabella !-- she is sadly taken away from us all !-- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here !" " She will not be surprized , papa , at least ." " I do not know , my dear . I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married ." " We must ask Mr . and Mrs . Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here ." " Yes , my dear , if there is time .-- But --( in a very depressed tone )-- she is coming for only one week . There will not be time for any thing ." " It	l
would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield ." Mr . Woodhouse could never allow for Mr . Knightley ' s claims on his brother , or any body ' s claims on Isabella , except his own . He sat musing a little while , and then said , " But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well ." " Ah ! papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will . Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ." This was too true for contradiction . Unwelcome as it was , Mr . Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them	l
that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ." After this speech he was gone as soon as possible . Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the	s
her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ?" " Oh ! yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury . By the bye , _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece . Heaven forbid ! at least , that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax . One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax . Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends	s
," before the gentleman joined them . The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting . He had been going to call on them . His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . Mr . Elton then turned back to accompany them . " To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ," thought Emma ; " to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of	s
power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily :	s
absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr . Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella ' s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety . The	l
bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs . John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the	s
resulted her brother ' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- It had a high claim to forbearance . CHAPTER XII Mr . Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr . Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ' s first day . Emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr . Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation . She hoped they might now become friends again . She thought it was time to make up . Making - up indeed would not do . _She_ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _he_ would never own that he had . Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when	l
he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ' s arms . It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . Emma felt they	s
were thus comfortably occupied , Mr . Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . " My poor dear Isabella ," said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children --" How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey ! You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go	s
me to have forgotten Mrs . and Miss Bates ," said Emma , " I have not heard one inquiry after them ." " Oh ! the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs . Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children .-- They are always so pleased to see my children .-- And that excellent Miss Bates !-- such thorough worthy people !-- How are they , sir ?" " Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ." " How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr . Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza ." " That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very	l
general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ." " No , I do not know that Mr . Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except -- " Ah ! my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season . Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be . It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there ! so far off !-- and the air so bad !" " No	s
head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming . I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr . Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case . I trust , at	s
so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town ! What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them ! I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all . She would be such a delightful companion for Emma ." Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , " Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet . Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet ." " I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly Emma ' s age ." This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of	l
, and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly ." " You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere .-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places . A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air . And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable . You should have consulted Perry ." " But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty ." " Ah ! my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred .-- Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . This is just what	l
she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs . Weston ." But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . " Well ," said she to herself , " this is most strange !-- After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind !-- Most strange indeed !-- But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any	l
report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as I had hoped --` Not better ' was _my_ answer ." His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . " Oh ! no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs . Goddard ' s door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning ." Emma smiled and answered --" My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . Mr . Perry has been with her , as you probably heard ." " Yes -- I imagined -- that is --	l
I did not --" " He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report . But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness . Such a sad loss to our party to - day !" " Dreadful !-- Exactly so , indeed .-- She will be missed every moment ." This was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began	s
; but now it is of no consequence . This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week . Nothing could be pleasanter . I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se ' nnight ." Mr . John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , "	s
Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before --" You must know , my dear Mrs . Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr . Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth . Mrs . Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now	s
sooner it could be over , the better ." " Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves . There is jealousy . They are jealous even of his regard for his father . In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr . Weston were less sanguine ." " He ought to come ," said Emma . " If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that . A young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ '	l
! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . Is this fair , Mrs . Weston ?-- Judge between us . Have not I some right to complain ? I am sure of your kind support and aid ." Emma saw Mrs . Weston ' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in	s
her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr . Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr . John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr . Woodhouse : " This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ." Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either	l
we shall get home very well . Another hour or two ' s snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight ." Mr . Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr . Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away . As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be	l
not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls . He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr . Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus -- " Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?" " I am ready , if the others are ." " Shall I ring the bell ?"	s
. Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed .-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of	l
retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it . These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present . The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church . Mr	s
. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr . Elton ' s absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr . Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,-- " Ah ! Mr	l
he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr . Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had Mr . Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them ." Emma was most agreeably surprized .-- Mr .	s
Elton ' s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . She had not even a share in his opening compliments .-- Her name was not mentioned ;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ' s suspicion . It did , however .-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . Mr . Woodhouse talked over	l
of cure , there could be no true peace for herself . CHAPTER XVIII Mr . Frank Churchill did not come . When the time proposed drew near , Mrs . Weston ' s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . For the present , he could not be spared , to his " very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period ." Mrs . Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband ,	s
, ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away . She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr . Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs . Weston ' s arguments against herself . " The Churchills are very likely in fault ," said Mr . Knightley , coolly ; " but I dare say he might come if he would ." " I do not know why you should say so . He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him ." " I cannot believe that he has not the power of	l
but you , Mr . Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr . Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him !-- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could !-- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ?" " Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . Respect would be added to affection . They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do	l
rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . Respect for right conduct is felt by every body . If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his ." " I rather doubt that	s
hardly know how to make enough of her now ." " Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ?" " Oh yes ; next week ." " Indeed !-- that must be a very great pleasure ." " Thank you . You are very kind . Yes , next week . Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things . I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she cannot say which ,	s
because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . So very good of them to send her the whole way ! But they always do , you know . Oh yes , Friday or Saturday next . That is what she writes about . That is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday ." " Yes , so I imagined . I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to - day ." " So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland .	l
by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !)-- But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr . Dixon !" " But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss	s
I could be so off my guard . If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr . Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time . Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her ." " I am afraid we must be running away ," said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --" My father will be expecting us . I had no intention , I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes , when I first entered the house . I merely called , because I would not pass the door without	l
child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ' s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell ' s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ' s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was Jane Fairfax ' s	l
fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever . The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did . As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness :-- what must be at last , had better be soon . Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished	l
reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . What arises from discretion must be honoured ." " You think her diffident . I do not see it ." " My dear Emma ," said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , " you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening ." " Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained ." "	s
- salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome ." " Emma ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you ." " News ! Oh ! yes	s
. He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield ." " A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse !" said Miss Bates , joyfully ; " my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress . This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr . Elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ." Jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing	s
, she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford ' s ."-- Ford ' s was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher ' s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place .--" And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd !-- but they always dealt at Ford ' s -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but	l
gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one . He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost . He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith . The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10 , 000 l . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction	l
, no alliance . Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol -- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago ,	s
an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise . And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages ! That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins . Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all ! She had talked her into love ; but , alas ! she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet ' s mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .	l
all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr . Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet ' s mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations .	l
Harriet must suffer . It was a bad business . She would have given a great deal , or endured a great deal , to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life . They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- Impossible !-- She could not repent . They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it . Her mind was quite sick of Mr . Elton and the Martins . The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary . It was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither " master nor mistress was at home ;" they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield . " This is too bad ," cried Emma , as they turned away . " And now we shall just	l
Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s . And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person . " Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for ," said he ; " but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs . Weston	s
." " You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs . Weston for my feelings ," said Emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ." " I hope I should know better ," he replied ; " no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow ,) that in addressing Mrs . Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms ." Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable . She had no doubt of what Mr . Weston was often thinking about . His quick	l
seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe . Of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind . He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . It was but an effusion of lively spirits . At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being	s
" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ." He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health . Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . " Well ," said Emma , " there is no disputing about taste .-- At least you admire her except her complexion ." He shook his head and laughed .--" I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion ." " Did you see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in the same society ?" At this moment they were approaching Ford ' s , and he hastily exclaimed , " Ha ! this must be the very shop that	l
thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly . As Mrs . Weston observed , " all young people would have their little whims ." There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed . In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr . Knightley . The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for ." She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ' s observation convinced her that it was really	l
said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave . This was the occurrence :-- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good	s
us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr . Knightley too , to take care of her , I cannot wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy ." Then turning to Mrs . Weston , with a look of gentle reproach --" Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me ." " Well , sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs . Goddard in a moment , if you wish it ." But the idea of any thing	l
your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs . Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up ." He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual . CHAPTER VIII Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ' s dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs . Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr . Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed . He came back , had had his hair cut ,	l
done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr . Knightley , he is _not_ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities .-- No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly ." With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time . She meant to be very happy , in spite of	l
her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it . She followed another carriage to Mr . Cole ' s door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr . Knightley ' s ; for Mr . Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma ' s opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey . She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out . " This is coming as you should do ," said she ; " like	l
a gentleman .-- I am quite glad to see you ." He thanked her , observing , " How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner ." " Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way	s
astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates ' s account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from Colonel Campbell . " One can suppose nothing else ," added Mrs . Cole , " and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . But Jane , it seems , had	s
a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her ." Mrs . Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs . Cole . " I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really	l
me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ." Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs . Cole ' s , turned to Frank Churchill . " Why do you smile ?" said she . " Nay , why do you ?" " Me !-- I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell ' s being so rich and so liberal .-- It is a handsome present ." " Very ." " I rather wonder that it was never made before ." " Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before ." " Or that he did not give her the use of their	l
but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ?" " What do you say to Mrs . Dixon ?" " Mrs . Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs . Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ' s scheme than an elderly man ' s . It is Mrs . Dixon , I dare say . I told you that your suspicions would guide mine ." " If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_ . Dixon in them ." " Mr . Dixon .-- Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr . and Mrs . Dixon . We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance ." " Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which	l
I had entertained before .-- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr . Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland	s
perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ' s countenance . They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill . In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly	s
idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr . Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ' s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ?" " Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted .-- Mr . Knightley marry !-- No , I have never had such an idea , and I cannot adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !" " Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know ." " But the imprudence of such a match !" " I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ." " I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention .	l
, and the instrument in preparation ;-- and at the same moment Mr . Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it . Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs . Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr . Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance . She knew the limitations	s
; quite enough still to stand at the door . A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer . She looked down the Randalls road . The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course . They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs . Bates ' s ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford ' s ; and had	s
left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ' s profit than any thing ; but Mrs . Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be	l
. I wanted to keep it from Jane ' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware ." Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will . " Pray take care , Mrs . Weston , there is a step at the turning . Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss Smith , pray take care . Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning ." CHAPTER X The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs . Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her	l
rate ." " I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe . You see we have been wedging one leg with paper . This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home ." He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again . That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again . At	l
last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to . Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise . " Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s	s
to succeed . Mr . Knightley cannot stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing . . . ." " Yes ," said Jane , " we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing ." " Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr . Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ?' said he ; so I just mentioned . . . . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going ?-- You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you ." Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs . Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for	l
Randalls . CHAPTER XI It may be possible to do without dancing entirely . Instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more . Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the	s
do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing !" Mrs . Weston was sorry for such a charge . She knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away . Every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on Frank Churchill ' s part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had	s
I trust you cannot , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs . Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable !-- Dreadful !-- I felt how right you were the whole time , but	s
was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange ?-- You consent -- I hope you consent ?" " It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not . I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be . Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?" She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable . " No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan -- much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it	l
with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ' s great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry ." " My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ," said Frank Churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ." Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone	l
My dear , you are too particular ," said her husband . " What does all that signify ? You will see nothing of it by candlelight . It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight . We never see any thing of it on our club - nights ." The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , " Men never know when things are dirty or not ;" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , " Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ." One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain . It regarded a supper - room . At the time of the ballroom ' s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition . What was to be done ? This card - room would be wanted as a card - room now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves , still was it not too small for any comfortable supper ? Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ;	l
but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it . This made a difficulty . Mrs . Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper . Mrs . Weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c ., set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion . A private dance , without sitting down	s
oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins . No !-- she was more and more convinced that Mrs . Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise . There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love . Alas ! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr . Knightley . Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing . A letter arrived from Mr . Churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return .	s
must be on my guard not to encourage it .-- It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto . No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different .-- Still , however , I must be on my guard . This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable .-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for	l
greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ." This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably . " You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life -- Want gratitude to you !-- Nobody is equal to you !-- I care for nobody as I do for you !-- Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !" Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before . " There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ," said she afterwards to herself . " There is nothing to be compared	l
his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr . Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . " Well , Miss Woodhouse ," said Harriet , when they had quitted the house	s
neat and pretty ; and the house was modern and well - built . Mrs . Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine . " Very like Maple Grove indeed !-- She was quite struck by the likeness !-- That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ' s favourite room ."-- Mr . Elton was appealed to .--" Was not it astonishingly like ?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove ." " And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ). A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is	l
struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony ." Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs . Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself . " So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is	s
of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England ." " Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry ." " No , I fancy not ," replied Mrs . Elton , with a most satisfied smile ." I never heard any county but Surry called so ." Emma was silenced . " My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest ," continued Mrs . Elton	s
; " and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr . Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King ' s - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ?" " No ;	l
not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ." " Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to	s
do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs . Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady ' s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer ." " Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea . A superior performer !-- very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely cannot do without music . It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice .	l
the world was not necessary to _me_ . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ` But ,' said I , ` to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'" " We cannot suppose ," said Emma , smiling , " that Mr . Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the	l
_me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music ." " But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?" " I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs . Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs . Bird and Mrs . James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate . Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ." " But every thing of that kind ,"	l
had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr . E .' s , I had a great curiosity . ` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much . Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man ." Happily , it was now time to	s
be gone . They were off ; and Emma could breathe . " Insufferable woman !" was her immediate exclamation . " Worse than I had supposed . Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley !-- I could not have believed it . Knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr . E ., and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr . Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs . Weston !-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse . I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would	l
absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse .-- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax .-- A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax .-- And her situation is so calculated to affect	s
," said Mr . Knightley warmly , " Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs . Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs . Elton , which nobody else pays her ." Emma felt that Mrs . Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth . With a faint blush , she presently replied , " Such attentions	s
of her in that way , I assure you ." And soon afterwards , " Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife ." Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault . " Well ," said she , " and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?" " Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him	s
." No invitation came amiss to her . Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners . She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties . Mrs . Bates , Mrs . Perry , Mrs . Goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order . Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons . They must not do less	l
little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother . The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma . John Knightley came ; but Mr . Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day . He might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner . Mr . Woodhouse was quite at ease	s
sad girl , how could you do such a thing ?-- It is a sign I was not there to take care of you ." Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . " Oh ! do not tell _me_ . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself .-- To the post - office indeed ! Mrs . Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority ." " My advice ," said Mrs . Weston	s
- office is a wonderful establishment !" said she .-- " The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing !" " It is certainly very well regulated ." " So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the	s
brother hesitatingly , " there is a likeness . I know what you mean -- but Emma ' s hand is the strongest ." " Isabella and Emma both write beautifully ," said Mr . Woodhouse ; " and always did . And so does poor Mrs . Weston "-- with half a sigh and half a smile at her . " I never saw any gentleman ' s handwriting "-- Emma began , looking also at Mrs . Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs . Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause	s
complexion and spirits . She could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails ;-- it was at her tongue ' s end -- but she abstained . She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax ' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each . CHAPTER XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after	s
. Elton . " Aye , _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself ;-- I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life ." " You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman ' s family is all that I should condition for ." " I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have	l
; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it ?-- Selina ' s choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ?" The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when Mr . Weston made his appearance among them . He had returned to a late dinner , and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over .	l
He had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize -- but there was great joy . Mr . Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before . John Knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time	s
to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . " Read it , read it ," said he , " it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma ." The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body . " Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it ?-- I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I ?-- Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?-- In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing	l
A most dangerous precedent indeed !-- I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example .-- Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves !-- Oh ! Mr . Weston , I could not have believed it of you !" " Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs . Elton .-- This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us	s
that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs . Churchill ' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time ." " Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?" " Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London . a considerable journey ." " Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr . Weston , to people of large fortune ?-- You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr . Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and Mr . Bragge went to London and back again with four horses ." " The evil of the distance from Enscombe ," said Mr . Weston , " is , that Mrs . Churchill , _as_ _we_ _understand_ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In	l
Frank ' s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ' s ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs . Elton . You must grant me that ." " No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing	s
company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us . Oh ! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ." She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on . " You were mentioning May . May is the very month which Mrs . Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe -- in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring -- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost	l
boys ; but you have your sister ' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ." " I rather hope to satisfy you both ," said Emma , " for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic ." " And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ." " That is very likely . You think so , do not you ?" " I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ." " Increase !" " Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in	l
with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you --( nodding at Mr . John Knightley )-- your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I cannot imagine . And as to my dear little boys ,	s
I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one -- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts ." Mr . Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs . Elton ' s beginning to talk to him . VOLUME III CHAPTER I A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill . She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .	l
spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state . It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr . Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill ' s feelings . The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards . He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act . They met with the utmost friendliness . There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her . But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree . She watched him well . It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been . Absence , with the	l
-- for the house was taken for May and June . She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects . He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered . She hoped it was not so . Two months must bring it to the proof . Mr . Weston ' s own happiness was indisputable . He was quite delighted . It was the very circumstance he could	s
see that there are umbrellas , sir ," said Frank to his father : " Miss Bates must not be forgotten :" and away he went . Mr . Weston was following ; but Mrs . Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing . " A very fine young man indeed , Mr . Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him .-- You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr . Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to	l
!-- I believe we drive faster than any body .-- What a pleasure it is to send one ' s carriage for a friend !-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ." Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs . Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs . Weston ' s to receive them . Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body ' s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire . As the door opened she was heard , " So very obliging of you !-- No rain at all . Nothing to signify . I do not care for myself . Quite thick shoes . And Jane declares -- Well !--( as	l
. Stokes ,' said I -- but I had not time for more ." She was now met by Mrs . Weston .-- " Very well , I thank you , ma ' am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs . Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment . Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs . Weston , on that score . Mrs . Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been .-- But two such offers in one day !-- Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma ' am --.' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr . Woodhouse ' s . I made her	l
her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs . Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was , " How do you like my gown ?-- How do you like my trimming ?-- How has Wright done my hair ?"-- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness . Mrs . Elton then said , " Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ' s eyes are so much upon me ,	s
. He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr . and Mrs . Weston . He had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before Emma . It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . " And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?" said Mr . Weston . " She will think Frank ought to ask her ." Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse	l
would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . Escape , however , was not his plan . He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- Emma saw it . She was not yet dancing ;	s
she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr . Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs . Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances .-- The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs . Weston had left her seat to join him and say , " Do not you dance , Mr . Elton ?" to which his prompt reply was , " Most readily , Mrs . Weston , if you will dance with me ." " Me !-- oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer ." " If Mrs . Gilbert wishes to dance ," said he	l
be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the	s
great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh !' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr . George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr . Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr . William Cox .' My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless . Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other !-- Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs . Elton is going ; dear Mrs . Elton , how elegant she looks !-- Beautiful lace !-- Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening !-- Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one . Well , I was	l
persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere .-- I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane ,-- There was a little disappointment .-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr . Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all	s
speaking to Mr . Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked . He was warm in his reprobation of Mr . Elton ' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs . Elton ' s looks also received the due share of censure . " They aimed at wounding more than Harriet ," said he . " Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?" He looked with smiling penetration ; and ,	s
on receiving no answer , added , " _She_ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be .-- To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet ." " I did ," replied Emma , " and they cannot forgive me ." He shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said , " I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections ." " Can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ?" " Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit .-- If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it ." " I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr . Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It was through a series of strange blunders !" "	l
bustle of Mr . Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again . " Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing ?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep !" " I am ready ," said Emma , " whenever I am wanted ." " Whom are you going to dance with ?" asked Mr . Knightley . She hesitated a moment , and then replied , " With you , if you will ask me ." " Will you ?" said he , offering his hand . " Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ." " Brother and sister ! no , indeed ." CHAPTER III This little explanation with Mr . Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure . It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding	l
respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet ' s infatuation .-- From Harriet ' s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she	s
faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained . Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long . A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole . Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm .-- About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies . A child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank	l
, cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury . But poor Harriet could not follow . She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain . How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an	s
an hour it was known all over Highbury . It was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news . The last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies . Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with . She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if	l
ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me ." " Yes ," said Emma , " I hope I do ." " How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . ." cried Harriet , warmly . " It seems like madness ! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him -- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid	s
him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night !-- However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil .-- No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ' s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept -- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Cannot you guess what this parcel holds ?" said she , with a conscious look . " Not the least in the world .-- Did he	l
ever give you any thing ?" " No -- I cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much ." She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top . Her curiosity was greatly excited . Harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience . Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a	s
something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ." " I do remember it ," cried Emma ; " I perfectly remember it .-- Talking about spruce - beer .-- Oh ! yes -- Mr . Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr . Elton ' s seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it .-- Stop ; Mr . Knightley was standing just here , was not he ? I have an idea he was standing just here ." " Ah ! I do not know . I cannot recollect .-- It is very odd , but I cannot recollect .-- Mr . Elton was sitting here , I	l
this subject , there is no denying that Mr . Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs . Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about	s
rapidly forming words for each other , or for any body else who would be puzzled . The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it . Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax . She gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it . Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr . Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation . The word was discovered , and with a faint smile pushed away . If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking	l
; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , " I did not know that proper names were allowed ," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered . Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt . " Aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --" I was just going to say the same thing . It is time for us to be going indeed . The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . My dear sir , you are too obliging . We really must wish you good night ." Jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived . She was immediately up , and wanting	l
to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr . Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr . Knightley could not tell . He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so	s
come till the autumn . No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present . In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs . Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs . Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all	s
to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings . This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr . Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs . Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs . Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be ,	s
" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you ." " Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever ." " I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ' s assistance ." " I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home ;-- and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt ." " You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow	l
Elton , and any other of his neighbours .-- He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma ' s , and Harriet ' s going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr . Knightley to invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out .-- He was not fond of dining out ." Mr . Knightley was fortunate in every body ' s most ready concurrence . The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs .	s
glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade ." Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs . Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs . Elton and Jane Fairfax were	s
talking of .-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question . Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures . It was not with Mrs . Suckling , it was not with Mrs . Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs . Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs . Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove . Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs . Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- Still Mrs . Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing	l
to Emma .-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- " Should not they walk ? Would not Mr . Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- She wished to see the whole extent ."-- The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear . It was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to	s
Mrs . Churchill ' s state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs . Weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of Mrs . Churchill that he was prevented coming .-- Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion . The cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old Abbey fish - ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again .-- Mr . Woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs	l
him , and now he would shew them all to Emma ;-- fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical .-- Before this second looking over was begun , however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape .-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of . " Will you be so kind ," said she , " when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I	l
glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet ' s sweet easy temper will not mind it ." He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late	s
person ." " You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us ." " No -- I shall not stir . I shall sit by you . You are my best cure ." " We are going to Box Hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ?" " No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening ." " But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning ." " No -- It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross ." " Then pray stay at Richmond ." " But if I do , I shall be crosser still . I can never	l
Woodhouse ' s presiding ; Mr . Knightley ' s answer was the most distinct . " Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?" " Oh ! no , no "-- cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could -- " Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now . Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr . Weston and Harriet ,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing ." " It is a sort of thing ," cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , " which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the _Chaperon_ of the party -- _I_ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women --" Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply , " Very true , my love , very true	l
it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . " Happy couple !" said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing :--" How well they suit one another !-- Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place !-- They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath ! Peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person ' s disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge . It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . Short of that , it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill - luck . How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life !" Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . " Such things do occur	l
Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance . How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible ." Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . " Nay , how could I help saying what I did ?-- Nobody could have helped it . It was not so very bad . I dare say she did not understand me ." " I assure you she did . She felt your full meaning . She has talked of it since . I wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity . I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and	l
your father , when her society must be so irksome ." " Oh !" cried Emma , " I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ." " They are blended ," said he , " I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance	s
it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell . They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . A whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it . _There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart . She hoped no one could have said to her , " How could you be so unfeeling to your father ?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can ." Miss Bates should never	l
sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax ' s advantage and comfort as possible . " It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell ' s return ." " So very kind !" replied Miss Bates . " But you are always kind ." There was no bearing such an " always ;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of -- "	s
she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that	s
of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs . Bates ' s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do ;-- Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse .-- Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . " Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- Mrs . Elton , indeed , could not be	l
of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life ." " Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and --" " Good God !" cried Emma , not attending to her .--" Mrs . Smallridge , too ! Jane actually on the point of	s
point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ." " _His_ sufferings ," replied Emma dryly , " do not appear to have done him much harm . Well , and how did Mr . Churchill take it ?" " Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family ! While poor Mrs . Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion ." " Ah !" thought Emma , " he would have done as much for Harriet ." " This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the	l
the other , which both might not have heard ." " You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady ." " True . But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe ." At this moment Mr . Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , " Now , dearest Emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour . It is not a connexion to gratify ; but if Mr . Churchill does not feel that	l
, why should we ? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . And how much may be said in her situation for even that error !" " Much , indeed !" cried Emma feelingly . " If a woman can	s
might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- She felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds . Common sense would	s
now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ' s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs . Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls . Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance . " Well , Miss Woodhouse !" cried Harriet , coming eagerly into the room -- " is not this the oddest news that ever was ?" " What news do you mean ?" replied Emma , unable to guess	s
not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly ." " Me !" cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished . " Why should you caution me ?-- You do not think I care about Mr . Frank Churchill ." " I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ," replied Emma , smiling ; " but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?" " Him !-- never , never . Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?" turning away distressed . " Harriet !" cried Emma , after a moment ' s pause --" What do you mean ?-- Good Heaven ! what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--" She could	l
other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . Are you speaking of -- Mr . Knightley ?" " To be sure I am . I never could have an idea of any body else -- and so I thought you knew . When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ." " Not quite ," returned Emma , with forced calmness , " for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person . I could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr . Frank Churchill . I	s
am sure the service Mr . Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of ." " Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget !" " My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion . I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural :-- and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue .-- The impression of it is strong on my memory ." " Oh , dear ," cried Harriet , " now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time . It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr . Frank Churchill that I meant . No ! ( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- of Mr . Knightley ' s coming and asking me to dance , when Mr	l
, I cannot be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _is_ possible --" She paused a few moments . Emma could not speak . " I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse ," she resumed , " that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body . You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other . But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if -- strange as it may appear --. But you know they were your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened , matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between Mr . Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before -- and if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to -- if Mr . Knightley should really -- if _he_ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it	l
of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain . On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question . " Might he not ?-- Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr . Martin -- he might have Mr . Martin ' s interest in view ? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit . " Mr . Martin ! No indeed !-- There was not a hint of Mr . Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr . Martin , or to be suspected of it ." When Harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope . " I never should have presumed to think of it at first ," said she , " but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and	l
. To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour . To that point went every leisure moment which her father ' s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind . How long had Mr . Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ? When had his influence , such influence begun ?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied ?-- She looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter ' s becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it -- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .	l
and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for " such things ," he observed , " always got about ." Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so . They had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene . They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them . Miss Fairfax ' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for	l
these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement . Mrs . Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject . " On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ," continued Mrs . Weston , " she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour :'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart ." " Poor girl !" said Emma . " She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?" " Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more	l
, and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , " We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . " Are you well , my Emma ?" was Mrs . Weston ' s parting question . " Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible ." Mrs . Weston ' s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax . She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings	l
it cleared ; the wind changed into a softer quarter ; the clouds were carried off ; the sun appeared ; it was summer again . With all the eagerness which such a transition gives , Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible . Never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her . She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr . Perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr . Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London . She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind . She must be collected and calm .	l
cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received . They walked together . He was silent . She thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . And this belief produced another dread . Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject . He must do it all himself . Yet she could not bear this silence . With him it was most unnatural . She considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began -- " You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you ." " Have I ?" said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?" " Oh ! the	l
with another .-- It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _not_ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him ." She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought . At last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said , " I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill .-- I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him . My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish	l
. She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought . While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him .-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision ;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy ?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great -- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it .-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury	l
this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs . Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr . Knightley came again , she desired him to read it . She was sure of Mrs . Weston ' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr . Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct . "	l
one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ." He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , " Humph ! a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way . One man ' s style must not be the rule of another ' s . We will not be severe ." " It will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as I read . By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you . It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it --" " Not at all . I should wish it ." Mr . Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . " He trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation . He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father '	l
ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist . " There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the Eltons ," was his next observation .--" His feelings are natural .-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- Well , he must be a most extraordinary --" " Nay , nay , read on .-- You will find how very much he suffers ." " I hope he does ," replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . "` Smallridge !'-- What does this mean ? What is all this ?" " She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs . Smallridge ' s children -- a dear friend of	l
regarded . Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt . This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield -- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her !-- Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy ! She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield . The delightful family party which Emma was securing for	l
supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early . Mr . Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ;-- not like Mr . Elton . Mr . Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year . CHAPTER XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . Their intercourse was painful enough by letter . How much worse , had they been obliged to meet ! Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment	l
the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time .-- A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers . She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax .-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to	l
had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , " We can finish this some other time , you know . You and I shall not want opportunities . And , in fact , you have heard all the essential already . I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs . S . admits our apology , and is not offended . You see how delightfully she writes . Oh ! she is a sweet creature ! You would have doated on her , had you gone .-- But not a word more . Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment : " For when a lady ' s in the case , " You know all other things give place ." Now I say , my dear , in _our_ case , for _lady_ , read ---- mum ! a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ? But I	l
Smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- She could not enter on it .-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them . This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining . She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella ' s letters . He might observe that it was so . The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy . Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what	l
but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma . How to	l
of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it . Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world . If any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps . The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and Mr . Weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind .-- He saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it . " It is to be a secret , I conclude ," said he . " These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out	l
, again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face . " Does nothing occur to you ?-- Do not you recollect ?-- Harriet Smith ." Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what . " Have you heard from her yourself this morning ?" cried he . " You have , I believe , and know the whole ." " No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me ." " You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin ." Emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , " No , this is impossible !" but her lips were closed . " It is so , indeed ," continued Mr . Knightley ; " I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago ." She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . " You like it , my Emma , as little as I	l
preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . She must laugh at such a close ! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart -- such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure in her returning -- Every thing would be a pleasure . It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr . Knightley would soon be over . The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs . Weston would be disappointed . They arrived	l
used to do ?-- You see how my father and Mrs . Weston doat upon her ." But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon .-- Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . " I can never think of it ," she cried , " without extreme shame ." " The shame ," he answered , " is all mine , or ought to be . But is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- I mean of late . Early , I know , you had none ." " I never had the smallest , I assure you ." " That appears quite wonderful . I was once very near -- and I wish I had -- it would have been better . But though I was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service .-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing ." " It is not now	l
Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter ' s continuing in singleness requires explanation . Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake . For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother ' s rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . His two other children were of very inferior value . Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles	l
A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ), there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem . He had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work . All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably . It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with	l
her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away . She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of . The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq ., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her . She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot ' s death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in	l
it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell ' s influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation . Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell ' s too gentle reductions . How Anne ' s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence . Lady Russell ' s had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne . " What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table -- contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms ."	l
in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years ." " Then I take it for granted ," observed Sir Walter , " that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery ." Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman . Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ;	l
of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen . Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer . So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral ' s situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . " I have let my house to Admiral Croft ," would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere Mr --; a Mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation ,) always needs	l
and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way ." " You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . It is early ." " I never want them , I assure you . They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . Oh ! Anne , I am so very unwell ! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday ." " My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner ."	l
with true naval alertness , and were to be visited . Mary deplored the necessity for herself . " Nobody knew how much she should suffer . She should put it off as long as she could ;" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back . Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going . She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression	l
come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard ! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte . I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ?), they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma ' s head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard ' s captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man	l
child ' s situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account . His collar - bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas . It was an afternoon of distress , and Anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants . Her brother ' s return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary . Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were	l
, when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house . " Nothing can be going on better than the child ," said he ; " so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right . Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all . You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use . Anne will send for me if anything is the matter ." Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles ' s manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him . She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only Anne to hear -- " So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the	l
was soon over . In two minutes after Charles ' s preparation , the others appeared ; they were in the drawing - room . Her eye half met Captain Wentworth ' s , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to Mary , said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it . Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could . " It is over ! it is over !" she repeated to herself again and again , in nervous gratitude . " The worst is over !" Mary talked , but she could not attend . She had seen him . They had met . They had been once more in the same room . Soon	l
. This was his only secret exception , when he said to his sister , in answer to her suppositions :-- " Yes , here I am , Sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match . Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking . A little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and I am a lost man . Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ?" He said it , she knew , to be contradicted . His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with . " A strong mind , with sweetness of manner ," made the first and the last of the description . " That is the woman I want ," said he . " Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with , but it must not be much . If I am a fool , I shall	l
to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth . His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and " That was in the year six ;" " That happened before I went to sea in the year six ," occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , Anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself . There must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain . They had no conversation together , no intercourse but what the commonest civility required . Once so much to each other ! Now nothing ! There had been a time , when of all the large party now filling the drawing	l
perpetual estrangement . When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind . There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c ., and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove ' s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying -- " Ah ! Miss Anne , if it had pleased	l
great object , I wanted to be doing something ." " To be sure you did . What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again ." " But , Captain Wentworth ," cried Louisa , " how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you ." " I knew pretty well what she was before that day ;" said he , smiling . " I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself . Ah ! she was a dear old Asp to me . She did all that I wanted . I knew she would . I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and	l
Chapter 9 Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral ' s fraternal kindness as of his wife ' s . He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off . There was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of Edward ' s wife upon credit a little longer . It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day . The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their	l
without any disapprobation . " It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him ,"-- and Henrietta did seem to like him . Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten . Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne ' s observation reached . Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four	l
Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied ." " Charles may say what he pleases ," cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , " but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt that he has . She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday . I wish you had been there to see her behaviour . And as to Captain Wentworth ' s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best . But Charles is so positive ! I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me ." A dinner at Mr Musgrove ' s had been	l
be tossed out as not ." " Ah ! You make the most of it , I know ," cried Louisa , " but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else ." It was spoken with enthusiasm . " Had you ?" cried he , catching the same tone ; " I honour you !" And there was silence between them for a little while . Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again . The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . She roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , " Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop	l
and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill . Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth -- " It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life ." She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of . The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a	l
their still being , in some spot or other . Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on till she overtook her . Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . They were speaking as they drew near . Louisa ' s voice was the first distinguished . She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech . What Anne first heard was -- " And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No ,	l
gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing . It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on . You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . Let those who would be happy be firm	l
comes of the peace . If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . We sailors , Miss Elliot , cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war . How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ?" " We had better not talk about it , my dear ," replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; " for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . I had known you by character , however , long before ." " Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I	l
young people were all wild to see Lyme . Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth . The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning	l
been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . He had been engaged to Captain Harville ' s sister , and was now mourning her loss . They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion . Fortune came , his prize - money as lieutenant being great ; promotion , too , came at last ; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it . She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea . Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must	l
sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh - feeling breeze -- and were silent ; till Henrietta suddenly began again with -- " Oh ! yes ,-- I am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea - air always does good . There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month . He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . Now , I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am	l
look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything ! I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross ." Anne was amused by Henrietta ' s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta ' s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them . They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready ; but Louisa recollecting , immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop , invited them all to go back with her into the town . They were all at her disposal . When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a	l
circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; Elizabeth ' s particular share in it she suspected ; and that Mr Elliot ' s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt . Mary never wrote to Bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne . Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme . They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could . Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street . Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord	l
of being in tolerable time ." At first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , Captain Wentworth , exerting himself , said -- " We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable . Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly . Musgrove , either you or I must go ." Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would . So far it was decided ; and Henrietta at first declared the same . She , however , was soon persuaded to think differently . The usefulness of her staying ! She who had not been able to remain in Louisa ' s room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless ! She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till	l
stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one . Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne ." She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of . The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared . " You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ;" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past . She coloured deeply , and he recollected himself and moved away . She expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain . " It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do . A bed on the floor in Louisa ' s room would be sufficient for her , if Mrs Harville would but think so ." One thing more , and all seemed arranged . Though it was rather desirable that Mr and	l
, and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot ' s not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove ' s recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter ! The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming -- " Ay , a very bad business indeed . A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress ' s head ,	l
to Camden Place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin - men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint . No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like Mrs Musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness . Anne did not share these feelings . She persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for Bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ? And looked back , with fond regret , to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch . Elizabeth ' s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest .	l
have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself . How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot ' s frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to . " Oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot . They did not know	l
only to be useful . You must not run away from us now . You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis , the beautiful Mrs Wallis . To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification ." He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself . Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay . In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her " less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher . Had she been using any thing in particular ?" " No , nothing ." " Merely Gowland ," he supposed . " No , nothing at all ." "	l
admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . She always takes the right time for applying . Everybody ' s heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . She is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who	l
conversation , I assure you , is a treat ." Anne , far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied , " I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes ." " Yes ," said Mrs Smith more doubtingly , " sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that	l
It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith ; she shook it off , and soon added in a different tone -- " I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now ." Anne had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place . At last , it became necessary to speak of her . Sir Walter , Elizabeth and Mrs Clay , returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening , and Anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings . She was	l
for his conduct . She distrusted the past , if not the present . The names which occasionally dropt of former associates , the allusions to former practices and pursuits , suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been . She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection . Her early impressions were incurable . She prized the frank , the open - hearted ,	l
do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention . Charles joins me in love , and everything proper . Yours affectionately , " Mary M ---. " I am sorry to say that I am very far from well ; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore - throat very much about . I dare say I shall catch it ; and my sore - throats , you know , are always worse than anybody ' s ." So ended the first part , which had been afterwards put into an envelope , containing nearly as much more . " I kept my letter open , that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey , and now I am extremely glad I did , having a great deal to add . In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore	l
know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week . The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . But even then there was something odd in their way of going on . Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward . When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward ' s , and there he has been ever since . We have seen nothing of him since November . Even Sophy could not understand it . But now , the matter has take the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick . You know James Benwick ." " A little . I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick ." " Well , she is to marry him . Nay , most likely they are married already ,	l
rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , " I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . He will be here in a moment , I am sure ." She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in . Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly . There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a " Good morning to you !" being all that she had time for , as she passed away . As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of Captain Wentworth ' s party began talking of them . " Mr Elliot	l
, the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head . " Now , how would she speak of him ?" " You will wonder ," said she , " what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description ." Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that	l
to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said -- " I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme . I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time ." She assured him that she had not . " It was a frightful hour ," said he , " a frightful day !" and he passed his hand across his eyes , as if the remembrance were still too painful , but in a moment , half smiling again , added , " The day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery ." " Certainly I could have none . But it appears -- I should	l
looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way . The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : Anne was among those on the foremost , and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis , as to have a seat by her . Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis ' s gallantry , was quite contented . Anne ' s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act . Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the	l
a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and Anne was all curiosity . She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain . He delighted in being asked , but he would not tell . " No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her ." Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth ' s brother . He might have been in Mr Elliot ' s company , but she had not courage to ask the question . " The name of Anne Elliot ," said he , " has long had an interesting sound to me . Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared ,	l
, " is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ?" " Mr Elliot !" repeated Anne , looking up surprised . A moment ' s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under . She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , " Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ?" " I have been a good deal acquainted with him ," replied Mrs Smith , gravely , " but it seems worn out now . It is a great while since we met ." " I was not at all aware of this . You never mentioned it before . Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you ." " To confess the truth ," said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , " that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have . I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him . He can be of essential service to me ; and	l
must consider me only as Mr Elliot ' s relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me ." Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said -- " I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have waited for official information , But now , my dear Miss Elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak . Next week ? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot ' s good fortune ." " No ," replied Anne , " nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry Mr Elliot . I should like to know why you imagine I am ?" Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked	l
of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it ." This was the letter , directed to " Charles Smith , Esq . Tunbridge Wells ," and dated from London , as far back as July , 1803 : -- " Dear Smith ,-- I have received yours . Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but	l
nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year . " I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of Walter I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W . again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly ,-- Wm . Elliot ." Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said -- " The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ?" Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to	l
and I shall not leave off now ." " Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove ," exclaimed Anne , " should be happy in their children ' s marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ?" He answered rather hesitatingly , " Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ." Anne could not help laughing . " That cannot be much to your taste , I know ," said she ; "	l
with him last Monday than ever I did before . We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father ' s great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since ." Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles ' s following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill - will of envy in it . She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could , but she did not want to lessen theirs . The visit passed off altogether in high good humour . Mary was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother - in - law ' s carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of Camden Place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought ,	l
; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining . A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected . A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and Anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining - room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove , and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth . The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment . It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again . Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away	l
few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind . " Anne ," cried Mary , still at her window , " there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me . Good heavens ! I recollect . It is Mr Elliot himself ." " No ," cried Anne , quickly , " it cannot be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow ." As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin	l
, as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank . He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it . " Only think of Elizabeth ' s including everybody !" whispered Mary very audibly . " I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he cannot put the card out of his hand ." Anne caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her . The party separated . The gentlemen had their own pursuits , the ladies proceeded on their own business , and they met no more while Anne belonged to them . She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose . Promising to be with them the	l
, I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement --" " Yes , dear ma ' am ," said Mrs Croft , " or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can ." Anne found an unexpected interest here . She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth ' s pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with	l
a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , " Come to me , I have something to say ;" and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation . She roused herself and went to him . The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to Captain Wentworth ' s table , not very near . As she joined him , Captain Harville ' s countenance re - assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character . " Look here ," said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting , " do you know who that is ?" " Certainly : Captain Benwick ." " Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But ," ( in a deep tone ,) " it was not done for her . Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I	l
towards tranquillity . Every moment rather brought fresh agitation . It was overpowering happiness . And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , Charles , Mary , and Henrietta all came in . The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more . She began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself . They could then see that she looked very ill , were shocked and concerned , and would not stir without her for the world . This was dreadful . Would they only have gone away , and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure ; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting , and in desperation , she said she would go home . " By all means , my dear ," cried Mrs Musgrove , " go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening . I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I	l
that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa ' s accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty . " I found ," said he , " that I was considered by Harville an engaged man ! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . I was startled and shocked . To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal . I was hers in honour if she wished it . I had been unguarded . I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at	l
fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother ' s , meaning after a while to return to Kellynch , and act as circumstances might require . " I was six weeks with Edward ," said he , " and saw him happy . I could have no other pleasure . I deserved none . He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter ." Anne smiled , and let it pass . It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight - and - twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own	l
daughter of a foolish , spendthrift baronet , who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him , and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter . Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . On the contrary , when he saw more of Captain Wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well - sounding name , enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour . The only one among them , whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was	l
Russell and Mrs Smith . To those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself . Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently . Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two . She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband ' s property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his	l
for his widow and daughters . His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him Mr . Dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters . Mr . John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable . His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr . John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . He was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was	l
mind . In seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself . But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy . Mrs . John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters . To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree . She begged him to think again on the subject . How could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount . It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why	l
mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it . " I hope , Marianne ," continued Elinor , " you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you cannot , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him ." Marianne hardly knew what to say . She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account , and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible . At length she replied : " Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable ." " I am sure ," replied Elinor , with a smile	l
; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne ' s conviction of their attachment agreeable to her . She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister . " I do not attempt to deny ," said she , " that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him ." Marianne here burst forth with indignation -- " Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment ." Elinor could not help laughing . " Excuse me ," said she ; " and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short ,	l
doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we cannot know ; but , from Fanny ' s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank ." Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth . " And you really are not engaged to him !" said she . " Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw	l
of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . The prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . With the size and furniture of the house Mrs . Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . " As for the house itself , to be sure ," said she , " it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money ,	l
wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly ." In the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . Marianne ' s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and Elinor ' s drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to Barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs	l
performance was highly applauded . Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one ' s attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished . Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel ' s advanced state of life which	l
at Allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood . The honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions .-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . Every	l
what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue ." " Aye , aye , I see how it will be ," said Sir John , " I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon ." " That is an expression , Sir John ," said Marianne , warmly , " which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one ' s cap at a man ,' or ' making a conquest ,' are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity ." Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied , " Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is	l
