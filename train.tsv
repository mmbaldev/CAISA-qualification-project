" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel !"-- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , " He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for _her_ . She deserves a better fate ." Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , " You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right .-- I am not in want of	s

one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F . C . WESTON CHURCHILL . CHAPTER XV This letter must make its way to Emma ' s feelings . She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs . Weston foretold . As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when	s
s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father . Mr . Weston ' s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr . Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it .-- Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here ." " And I have not forgotten ," said Emma , " how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ." " I was	s
herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from . She would be a loser in every way . Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . In time , of course , Mr . Knightley would be forgotten , that is ,	s
wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , " Beg her to walk up ;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . There was consciousness , animation	s
to penetrate Mrs . Elton ' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she	s
cloud upon the spirits of some .-- So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken . However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception ." Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her	s
himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation .-- Mr . E . is Knightley ' s right hand ." Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , " Is Mr . Elton gone on foot to Donwell ?-- He will have a hot walk ." " Oh ! no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead .-- I fancy Mr . E	s
My dear Mr . E ., he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must .-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss .-- I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs . Hodges , Wright holds her	s
I love every thing that is decided and open !-- Good - bye , good - bye ." CHAPTER XVII Mrs . Weston ' s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston . She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella ' s sons	s
at all . It will be the only difference ." " Poor child !" cried Emma ; " at that rate , what will become of her ?" " Nothing very bad .-- The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . I , who am owing all my happiness to _you_ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ?" Emma laughed , and replied : " But	s
feared .-- I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ." " You mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself . " It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I cannot believe it . It seems an impossibility !-- You cannot mean to say , that Harriet Smith has	s
I was !-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ." " You ought to know your friend best ," replied Mr . Knightley ; " but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her ." Emma could not help laughing as she answered , " Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do	s
and for Robert Martin ' s sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her . I have often talked to her a good deal . You must have seen that I did . Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin ' s cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions ,	s
sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . " She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often . It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it ." Frank Churchill caught the name .	s
did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ' s approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations .-- Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening	s
, that his daughter ' s courage failed . She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr . Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed . In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation	s
in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man . Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion . His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on	s
be her home . Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell ' s spending some	s
their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young ." It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter ' s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ;	s
with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter ' s estimate of the dues	s
, youth - killing dependence ! It must not be , if by any fair interference of friendship , any representations from one who had almost a mother ' s love , and mother ' s rights , it would be prevented . Captain Wentworth had no fortune . He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be	s
its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ' squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller ' s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on . Here Anne had often been staying . She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch	s
will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one ' s own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward . So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it ." A little further perseverance in patience and	s
acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into . With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible . She had no dread of these two months . Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so	s
from books or anything else . He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ' s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne ' s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ), they might pass for a happy couple . They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ;	s
she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . " I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill ," was Charles ' s language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : " I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse	s
so often as I otherwise should . I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ." She had this communication , moreover , from Mary . " Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would	s
could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ' s benefit . In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well . Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ; Mary ' s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since	s
only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money . In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of	s
she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week . Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove ' s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour . She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy ' s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The	s
evening ! I knew how it would be . This is always my luck . If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and Charles is as bad as any of them . Very unfeeling ! I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy . Talks of his being going on so well ! How does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? I did	s
Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone . An excellent thought of yours , indeed , Anne . I will go and tell Charles , and get ready directly . You can send for us , you	s
, however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less . Eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up . How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness ! What might not eight years do ? Events of every description , changes , alienations , removals -- all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past -- how natural , how certain too ! It included nearly a third part of her own	s
old built sloop , you would not see her equal . Lucky fellow to get her ! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his ." " I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ;" replied Captain Wentworth , seriously . " I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very	s
I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted . I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck . We had not been six hours in the Sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the	s
sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment . Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the	s
much less calculated for making matters easy -- Charles Hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne . She only attempted to say , " How do you do ? Will you not sit down ? The others will be here presently ." Captain Wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ;	s
her . After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , Captain Wentworth added : -- " What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister ! They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . They talked of coming into this side of the country . I wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day . Oh ! it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve	s
suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely . Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive ,	s
lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville , to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging - house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected . The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and	s
whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved . They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being " so	s
claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ' s being married . " I wish ," said Henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , " I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley . I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ! I always	s
who is just gone away ?" " Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth . Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London ." " Elliot !" Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . " Bless me !" cried Mary ; "	s
looked at him more . I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us . What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other ! Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ? I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! Oh ! the great - coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms ,	s
Had not she better be carried to the inn ? Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn ." " Yes , yes , to the inn ," repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something . " I will carry her myself . Musgrove , take care of the others ." By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the	s
Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and Captain Wentworth proposed , and Charles Musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave Mr Musgrove ' s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa ' s night . Captain Wentworth now hurried off to	s
in this way , that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once . She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved . They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve	s
all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike Anne Elliot ! An hour ' s complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell ' s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping	s
the laundry - door , at Uppercross . That has been a very great improvement . The wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long ! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them ,	s
but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together . Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville	s
I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . I wish he may be induced to call here . And when he does , Mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand ." " You will not like him , I will answer for it ." Lady Russell began talking of something else . Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing , Mr Elliot so extraordinarily . " He is a man ," said	s
the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father ' s grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however .	s
. It might be him , perhaps ." They could not listen to her description of him . They were describing him themselves ; Sir Walter especially . He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , " must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . Mr	s
more of , as herself . They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person ' s look also . They did not always think alike . His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister ' s solicitudes on a	s
the warm bath . Yet , in spite of all this , Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression , to hours of occupation and enjoyment . How could it be ? She watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only . A submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily	s
not sorry for the excuse . They were only asked , she was sure , because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold , was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her ; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity --" She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow ." They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne ; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and Elizabeth was disdainful ,	s
of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot . Though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character . That he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough . He certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer	s
. Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it . And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick ' s being supposed to be an admirer of yours . How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now . Certainly not a	s
interrupted her with -- " And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from Frederick himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross ." This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , " I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in	s
than Miss Anne ' s ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal , that his cousin Anne ' s boots were rather the thickest . It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the	s
Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family ." " I knew you by report long before you came to Bath . I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years . Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me ." Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise . No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery . To have been described long ago to	s
to talk to him . She wished him not so near her . The first act was over . Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move . She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on	s
if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done ." " I should be extremely happy ; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you ," replied Anne ; " but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You	s
earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed -- " Now , how I do wish I understood you ! How I do wish I knew what you were at ! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my	s
struck by a sudden idea , " you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ?" " To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from --" She checked herself just in time . " This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night ," cried Anne . " This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is	s
her father . She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say -- " Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ?" " I can explain this too	s
, a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . When I talked of a whole history	s
present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not ." " Lessening , I understand ," replied Mrs Smith . " He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . Mrs Wallis has an amusing	s
but I shall know better what to do . My line of conduct will be more direct . Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness ." But Mr Elliot was not done with . Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and	s
picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and Anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend ' s usual state of mind . There was one	s
unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together . But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better ." Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell ! And under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time	s
family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles ' s leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove ' s history of Louisa , and to Henrietta ' s of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody	s
station , with less bare - faced design , by Anne . " You have not been long enough in Bath ," said he , " to enjoy the evening parties of the place ." " Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card - player ." " You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes ." " I am not yet so much changed ," cried Anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what	s
did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , " how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was	s
W . " I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible . A word , a look , will be enough to decide whether I enter your father ' s house this evening or never ." Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from . Half and hour ' s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing	s
am no doctor myself . Charles , ring and order a chair . She must not walk ." But the chair would never do . Worse than all ! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall	s
s could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . From	s
calculations , till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick . " Here ," said he , " ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something . But to be waiting so long in inaction , and waiting only for evil , had been dreadful . Within the first five minutes I said , ` I will be at Bath on Wednesday ,' and I was . Was it	s
see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you ! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent , to consider what powerful supports would be his ! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ? How could I look on without agony ? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what	s
!" was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough . " Good God !" he cried , " you would ! It is not that I did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but I was proud , too proud to ask again . I did not understand you . I shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice . This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself . Six years	s
also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . The old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . He was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ;-- but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . Mr . Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son	s
want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds ." " That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean .-- My sisters	s
whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections . She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . Her resolution was formed as she read . The situation of Barton , in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was	s
their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . But Mrs . Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland . He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to	s
might at present be deficient . Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty . He had formerly visited at Stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . His countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and	s
infirmity of declining life ?" " My dearest child ," said her mother , laughing , " at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty ." " Mamma , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing	s
expense of the other ." " It would be impossible , I know ," replied Elinor , " to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders ." " But	s
, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ?" " I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must ." " I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for	s
created . But when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay . It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk . She could not be silent when	s
his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer . He came to them every day . To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by Marianne ' s perfect recovery . She was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome . Willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively	s
; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs . Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ?" " But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust ." "	s
by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . Willoughby was out of the question . Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne ' s , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . Colonel Brandon ,	s
charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage ." After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying ,-- " Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ?" " Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment ' s being pardonable ." " This ," said he , " cannot hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they	l
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances "-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor ' s head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had	s
, I thank you ." " Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse ." " No , ma ' am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business ." " But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this won ' t do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it ." " My dear madam ," said Lady Middleton , " recollect what you are	s
had hitherto restrained , now burst forth universally ; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . " I can guess what his business is , however ," said Mrs . Jennings exultingly . " Can you , ma ' am ?" said almost every body . " Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure ." " And who is Miss Williams ?" asked Marianne . " What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel ' s , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies ." Then , lowering her voice a little , she said to Elinor , " She is his natural daughter ." " Indeed !" " Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune ." When Sir John returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an	l
Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr . Willoughby ' s groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs . Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs . Jennings was perfectly true . Marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it . " Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ?" " Yes , Marianne ,	l
my heart , and a good wife into the bargain ." So wondered , so talked Mrs . Jennings . Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture , and all seeming equally probable as they arose . Elinor , though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon , could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away , which Mrs . Jennings was desirous of her feeling ; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation , her wonder was otherwise disposed of .	s
It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on the subject , which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all . As this silence continued , every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both . Why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself , what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place , Elinor could not imagine . She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power ; for though Willoughby was independent , there was no reason to believe him rich . His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year ; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal , and he had himself often complained of his poverty . But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement , which in fact concealed nothing at all , she could not account ; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice , that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their	l
, " which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share ." Mrs . Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne , whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby , as plainly denoted how well she understood him . " How often did I wish ," added he , " when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one	s
' s behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness . " Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ?" said Mrs . Dashwood , when he was leaving them . " I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton ." He engaged to be with them by four o ' clock . CHAPTER 15 Mrs . Dashwood ' s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home . On their return from the park they found Willoughby ' s curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs . Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just . So far it was all as she had foreseen ; but on entering the	l
house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect . They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction , with her handkerchief at her eyes ; and without noticing them ran up stairs . Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them . He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion	s
which over - powered Marianne . " Is anything the matter with her ?" cried Mrs . Dashwood as she entered --" is she ill ?" " I hope not ," he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , " It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment !" " Disappointment ?" " Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs . Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you ." " To London !-- and are you going this morning ?" " Almost this moment ." " This is very unfortunate . But Mrs . Smith must be obliged ;-- and her business will not detain you from us long I hope ." He coloured as he replied , " You are very kind , but I have	l
one was silent . Mrs . Dashwood first spoke . " I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs . Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination ." " My engagements at present ," replied Willoughby , confusedly , " are of such a nature -- that -- I dare not flatter myself "-- He stopt . Mrs . Dashwood was too much astonished to speak , and another pause succeeded . This was broken by Willoughby , who said with a faint smile , " It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy ." He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room . They saw him step into his carriage , and in a minute it was out of sight . Mrs .	l
of a moment . And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? And now , after only ten minutes notice -- Gone too without intending to return !-- Something more than what be owned to us must have happened . He did not speak , he did not behave like himself . YOU must have seen the difference as well as I . What can it be ? Can they have quarrelled ? Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ?"-- " It was not inclination	s
valley , and chiefly in silence , for Marianne ' s MIND could not be controlled , and Elinor , satisfied with gaining one point , would not then attempt more . Beyond the entrance of the valley , where the country , though still rich , was less wild and more open , a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton , lay before them ; and on reaching that point , they stopped to look around them , and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the	s
the gentleman . Marianne looked again ; her heart sunk within her ; and abruptly turning round , she was hurrying back , when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her ; a third , almost as well known as Willoughby ' s , joined them in begging her to stop , and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars . He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her	s
grandeur , is our cottage ." " It is a beautiful country ," he replied ; " but these bottoms must be dirty in winter ." " How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ?" " Because ," replied he , smiling , " among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane ." " How strange !" said Marianne to herself as she walked on . " Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ?" " No , not all ," answered Marianne ; " we could not be more unfortunately situated ." " Marianne ," cried her sister , " how can you say so ? How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr . Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ?" " No ," said Marianne , in a low voice , " nor how many painful moments ." Elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor	l
, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c . extorting from him occasional questions and remarks . His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection . CHAPTER 17 Mrs . Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing	s
are Mrs . Ferrars ' s views for you at present , Edward ?" said she , when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire ; " are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ?" " No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life !" " But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no	s
," said Elinor , smiling , " we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ?" " About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT ." Elinor laughed . " TWO thousand a year ! ONE is my wealth ! I guessed	s
presume ?" " Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them ." " Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see ," said Elinor , " she is not at all altered ." " She is only grown a little more grave than she was ." " Nay , Edward ," said Marianne , " you need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself ." " Why should you think so !" replied he , with a sigh . " But gaiety never was a part of MY character ." " Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ' s ," said Elinor ; " I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry ." " I believe you are right ," he replied , " and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl ." " I have frequently detected myself	l
guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure ." " No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ?" " You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility ," said Edward to Elinor , " Do you gain no ground ?" " Quite the contrary ," replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne . " My judgment ," he returned , " is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister ' s . I never wish to offend , but I am	l
to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves . But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see Edward himself come out . " I am going into the village to see my horses ," said be , " as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently ." *** Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country ; in his walk to the village , he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage ; and the village itself , in a much higher situation than the cottage , afforded a general view of the whole , which had exceedingly pleased him . This was a subject which ensured Marianne ' s attention , and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes , and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him , when Edward interrupted her by saying , " You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque ,	l
and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and	s
the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque ." " I am afraid it is but too true ," said Marianne ; " but why should you boast of it ?" " I suspect ," said Elinor , " that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own ." " It is very true ," said Marianne , " that admiration of landscape scenery is	l
a ring before , Edward ," she cried . " Is that Fanny ' s hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker ." Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt -- but when she saw how much she had pained Edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his . He coloured very deeply , and giving a momentary glance at Elinor , replied , " Yes ; it is my sister ' s hair . The setting always	s
it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on Margaret ' s instructions , extended . Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day , or to drink tea with them that evening . On the present occasion , for the better entertainment of their visitor , towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute , he wished to engage them for both . " You MUST drink tea with us to night ," said he , " for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party ." Mrs . Jennings enforced the necessity . " And who knows but you may raise a dance ," said she . " And that will tempt YOU , Miss Marianne ." " A dance !" cried Marianne . " Impossible ! Who is to dance ?" " Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure .-- What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall	l
puzzled him before ; and when their visitors left them , he went immediately round her , and said , in a whisper , " I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ?" " What do you mean ?" " Shall I tell you ." " Certainly ." " Well then ; I guess that Mr . Willoughby hunts ." Marianne was surprised and confused , yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner , and after a moment ' s silence , said , " Oh , Edward ! How can you ?-- But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him ." " I do not doubt it ," replied he , rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth ; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general , founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr . Willoughby and herself , he would not have ventured to mention it . CHAPTER 19 Edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs . Dashwood to stay	l
to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all !" Mrs . Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . " She expects to be confined in February ," continued Mrs . Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr . Palmer if there was any news in the paper . " No , none at all ," he replied , and read on . " Here comes Marianne ," cried Sir John . " Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl ." He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself . Mrs . Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs . Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it . Mr . Palmer looked up on her entering the room , stared	l
at her some minutes , and then returned to his newspaper . Mrs . Palmer ' s eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room . She got up to examine them . " Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever ." And then sitting down again , she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room . When Lady Middleton rose	s
for them and they must come . Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them . Mrs . Jennings and Mrs . Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield . " Why should they ask us ?" said Marianne , as soon as they were gone . " The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any	s
people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather ." The rest of the company soon dropt in . " I am afraid , Miss Marianne ," said Sir John , " you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today ." Marianne looked very grave and said nothing . " Oh , don ' t be so sly before us ," said Mrs . Palmer ; " for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he	s
excessively pretty , and so does Mr . Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night ." Mrs . Palmer ' s information respecting Willoughby was not very material ; but any testimony in his favour , however small , was pleasing to her . " I am so glad we are got acquainted at last ," continued Charlotte .--" And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You can ' t think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts ." " You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ?" " Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married .-- He was a particular friend of Sir John ' s . I believe ," she added in a low voice , "	l
about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing . " John is in such spirits today !" said she , on his taking Miss Steeles ' s pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window --" He is full of monkey tricks ." And soon afterwards , on the second boy ' s violently pinching one of the same lady ' s fingers , she fondly observed , " How playful William is !" " And here is my sweet little Annamaria ," she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; " And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing !" But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship ' s head dress slightly scratching the child ' s neck , produced from this	l
her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other . With such a reward for her tears , the child was too wise to cease crying . She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected .-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother ' s arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours . " Poor little creatures !" said Miss Steele , as soon as they were gone . " It might	l
have been a very sad accident ." " Yet I hardly know how ," cried Marianne , " unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality ." " What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is !" said Lucy Steele . Marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell	s
them if they are tame and quiet ." " I confess ," replied Elinor , " that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence ." A short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by Miss Steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , " And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex ." In some surprise at the familiarity of this question , or at least	s
fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted .-- And to be better acquainted therefore , Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day . Sir John could do no more ; but he did not know that any more was required : to be together was , in his opinion , to be intimate , and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual , he had not a doubt of their being established friends . To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars ,-- and Elinor had not seen them	l
to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward ' s gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete . " Writing to each other ," said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , " is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you	l
an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one . She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary	s
, and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother ' s permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of	s
it was tuned ." And without farther ceremony , she turned away and walked to the instrument . Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech . " Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma ' am ," said Elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; " and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard ." The remaining five were now to draw their cards . " Perhaps ," continued	s
Elinor , " if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it ." " Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help ," cried Lucy , " for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all ." " Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed ," said Miss Steele -- " Dear little soul , how I do love her !" " You are very kind ," said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; " and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ?" Elinor joyfully profited by the	l
in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card - table . CHAPTER 24 In a firm , though cautious tone , Elinor thus began . " I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again ." " Thank you ," cried Lucy warmly , " for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday ." " Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me ," and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity , " nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ?" "	l
any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr . Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs . John Dashwood -- THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband ." " But Mrs . John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward ' s going into orders ." " Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little ." They were again silent for many minutes . At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh , " I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ?" " No ," answered Elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , " on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you ,	l
sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I ' ve quite set my heart upon it . Don ' t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I shan ' t put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I don ' t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word	l
for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it ." " I have a notion ," said Sir John , " that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it ." " Nay ,"	s
her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness . On being informed of the invitation , Mrs . Dashwood , persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters , and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself , how much the heart of Marianne was in it , would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account ; insisted on their both accepting it directly ; and then began to foresee , with her usual cheerfulness , a variety of	s
advantages that would accrue to them all , from this separation . " I am delighted with the plan ," she cried , " it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I cannot bear to have you so	l
; and as for the Miss Steeles , especially Lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them . Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel . With regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence . Marianne ' s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness , so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone . Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive . Her mother ' s affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who	l
seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal . Their departure took place in the first week in January . The Middletons were to follow in about a week . The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park , and were to quit it only with the rest of the family . CHAPTER 26 Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs . Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that	s
of what civility demanded towards herself . " Is your sister ill ?" said he . Elinor answered in some distress that she was , and then talked of head - aches , low spirits , and over fatigues ; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister ' s behaviour . He heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind . In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere . Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last . " Yes ,"	l
, expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision . It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there . " Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ?" said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels . She was answered in the negative . " Are you quite sure of it ?" she replied . " Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ?" The man replied that none had . " How very odd !" said she , in a low and disappointed voice , as she turned away to the window . " How odd , indeed !" repeated Elinor within herself , regarding her sister with uneasiness . " If she had not known him to be in town she	l
compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her . Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . She feared it was a strengthening regard . It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton . About a week after their arrival , it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived . His card was on the table when they came in from the morning ' s drive . " Good God !" cried Marianne , " he has been here while we were out ." Elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in London , now ventured to say , " Depend	l
then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing ." Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs . Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud . It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before	s
and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance . He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs . Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr . Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come . " I thought you were both in Devonshire ," said he . " Did you ?" replied Elinor . " When do you go back again ?" " I do not know ." And thus ended their discourse . Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life , as she was that evening , and never so much fatigued	l
by the exercise . She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street . " Aye , aye ," said Mrs . Jennings , " we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited ." " Invited !" cried Marianne . " So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John	s
unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr . Willoughby in your sister ' s writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to -? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains ." These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much . She was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time ,	l
you not shake hands with me ?" He could not then avoid it , but her touch seemed painful to him , and he held her hand only for a moment . During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure . Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil . After a moment ' s pause , he spoke with calmness . " I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs . Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope ." " But have you not received my notes ?" cried Marianne in the wildest anxiety . " Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven ' s sake tell me , what is the matter ?" He made no reply ; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned ; but as if , on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking , he	l
; for while she could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever , however they might be divided in future , her mind might be always supported . But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby -- in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him . CHAPTER 29 Before the house - maid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window - seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her . In this situation , Elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness , " Marianne , may I ask -?" " No , Elinor ," she replied , " ask nothing ; you will soon know all ."	l
The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby . Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and	s
she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world . In such circumstances , it was better for both that they should not be long together ; and the restless state of Marianne ' s mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed , but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place , made her wander about the house till breakfast time , avoiding the sight of every body . At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor ' s attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs . Jenning ' s notice entirely to herself . As this was a favourite meal with Mrs . Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered	l
that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor ' s distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , " Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he won ' t keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ?" Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore ,	l
trying to smile , replied , " And have you really , Ma ' am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister ' s being engaged to Mr . Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married ." " For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how	s
The latter , though unable to speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into Elinor ' s hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony . Elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to Willoughby ' s letter , read as follows : " Bond Street , January . " MY DEAR MADAM , " I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . I shall never reflect on my	l
hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs . Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . Mrs . Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had	s
any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness . A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , " Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you !" " I only wish ," replied her sister , " there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you ." This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , " Oh ! Elinor , I am miserable , indeed ," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs . Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . " Exert yourself , dear Marianne ," she cried , " if you would not kill yourself and all	l
the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period -- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful ." " Engagement !" cried Marianne , " there has been no engagement ." " No engagement !" " No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . He has broken no faith with me ." " But	s
it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ?" For a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , " Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby ." " Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ?" " By all the world , rather than by his own heart .	l
a voice of great compassion to Marianne , who turned away her face without attempting to answer . " How is she , Miss Dashwood ?-- Poor thing ! she looks very bad .-- No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon -- a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs . Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should	s
, walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend ' s affliction could be increased by noise . Marianne , to the surprise of her sister , determined on dining with them . Elinor even advised her against it . But " no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less ." Elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner ,	s
, for you to caution Mrs . Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr . Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe ." " Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown	l
am ," said Elinor , " we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon ." And then rising , she went away to join Marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till Elinor ' s entrance , had been her only light . " You had better leave me ," was all the notice that her sister received from her . " I will leave you ," said Elinor , " if you will	s
go to bed ." But this , from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering , she at first refused to do . Her sister ' s earnest , though gentle persuasion , however , soon softened her to compliance , and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow , and as she hoped , in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her . In the drawing - room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs . Jennings , with a wine - glass , full of something , in her hand . " My dear ," said she , entering , " I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister ." " Dear Ma ' am ," replied Elinor	l
, smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended , " how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself ." Mrs . Jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and Elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected	s
that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation ." " It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think "-- he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , " And your sister -- how did she --" " Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him ." " Ah !" said Colonel Brandon , " there is , indeed ! But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ?" " You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could ." He made no answer ; and soon afterwards	l
heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs . Jennings ' s entering into her sorrows with any compassion . " No , no , no , it cannot be ," she cried ; " she cannot feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it ." Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others , by the irritable refinement of	s
some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ?" He stopped . " I understand you ," said Elinor . " You have something to tell me of Mr . Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne . MY	s
was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one -- but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs . Brandon ' s , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies )	l
, to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out ,) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there	s
again the same grateful acknowledgments , and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him . CHAPTER 32 When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister , as they very soon were , the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see . Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of Willoughby , and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible . But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched . Her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a	l
gloomy dejection . She felt the loss of Willoughby ' s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the	s
He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one	s
of Folly ' s puppies ! and this was the end of it !" Mrs . Palmer , in her way , was equally angry . " She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was ." The rest of Mrs . Palmer ' s sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage , and communicating them to Elinor . She could soon tell at what coachmaker ' s the new carriage was building , by what painter Mr . Willoughby ' s portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse Miss Grey ' s clothes might be seen . The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a	l
heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake ." " Indeed I believe you ," replied Elinor ; " but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME ." " You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable -- you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you	l
and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that "-- lowering his voice to an important whisper --" will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES ." Recollecting himself , however , he added , " That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs . Ferrars , a very good -	s
for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker ' s hands , I must have sold out to very great loss ." Elinor could only smile . " Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at	s
to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of	s
enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having ; and Mr . Dashwood went away delighted with both . " I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny ," said he , as he walked back with his sister . " Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs . Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of	s
A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs . Ferrars ' power to distress her by it now ;-- and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her . She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person -- for Lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both . But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four . Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr . Davies to be perfectly happy . The dinner was a grand one	l
conjectural assertion on both sides ; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion , and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked . The parties stood thus : The two mothers , though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest , politely decided in favour of the other . The two grandmothers , with not less partiality , but more sincerity , were equally earnest in support of their own descendant . Lucy , who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other	s
law ' s hands , to admire them herself as they ought to be admired . Mrs . Ferrars looked exceedingly angry , and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever , pronounced in retort this bitter philippic , " Miss Morton is Lord Morton ' s daughter ." Fanny looked very angry too , and her husband was all in a fright at his sister ' s audacity . Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne ' s warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but Colonel Brandon ' s eyes , as they were fixed on Marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point . Marianne ' s feelings did not stop here . The cold insolence of Mrs . Ferrars ' s general behaviour to her sister , seemed , to her , to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor , as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror ; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility , she moved after a moment , to her	l
in its unpleasantest form , which they would each have been most anxious to avoid , had fallen on them .-- They were not only all three together , but were together without the relief of any other person . The ladies recovered themselves first . It was not Lucy ' s business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up . She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more . But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she ,	s
relations ." Fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said , " My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry !" Mr . Dashwood was convinced . He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately , and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year ; at the same time , however , slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless , by bringing Elinor to	l
effects that laid open the probability of greater . The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street , and all that reached Elinor of their influence there , strengthened her expectation of the event . Sir John , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking . Mrs . Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy	s
news ?" " No , ma ' am . What is it ?" " Something so strange ! But you shall hear it all .-- When I got to Mr . Palmer ' s , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear ,' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum --' and nurse said	s
enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs . Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it . She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy . What Mrs . Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself	l
, or any resentment against Edward . Elinor ' s office was a painful one .-- She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister ' s chief consolation ,-- to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion ,- and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it . She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward ' s engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief .-- THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror ,	l
and cried excessively . Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself ! As for Lucy Steele	s
, she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed .-- Marianne ' s feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment . The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , " How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ?" " I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told	l
She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs . Jennings talked of Edward ' s affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat .-- Such advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself . The next morning brought a farther trial of it , in a visit from their brother , who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair , and bring them news of his wife . " You have heard , I	s
living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns ." Elinor ' s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it . " If he would only have done as well by himself ," said John Dashwood , " as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody ' s power to assist him .	s
that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it , he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs . Ferrars ' s conduct , the Dashwoods ', and Edward ' s . Marianne ' s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs . Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party . CHAPTER 38 Mrs . Jennings was very	s
own . She felt all the force of that comparison ; but not as her sister had hoped , to urge her to exertion now ; she felt it with all the pain of continual self - reproach , regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before ; but it brought only the torture of penitence , without the hope of amendment . Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more . Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards	s
, of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett ' s Buildings . But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs . Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time . The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens , though it was only the second week in March . Mrs . Jennings and Elinor were of the number ; but Marianne , who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place . An intimate acquaintance of Mrs . Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with	l
a short time , to join their ' s . Mrs . Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor , " Get it all out of her , my dear . She will tell you any thing if you ask . You see I cannot leave Mrs . Clarke ." It was lucky , however , for Mrs . Jennings ' s curiosity and Elinor ' s too , that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked ; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt . " I am so glad to meet you ;" said Miss Steele , taking her familiarly by the arm --" for I wanted to see you of all things in the world ." And then lowering her voice , " I suppose Mrs . Jennings has heard all about it . Is she angry ?" " Not at all , I believe , with you ." " That is a good thing . And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ?" " I cannot suppose it possible that she should ." " I am monstrous glad of it . Good gracious ! I have had such a time of it ! I never saw Lucy	l
in such a rage in my life . She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever . Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night . There now , YOU are going to laugh at me too . But why should not I wear pink ribbons ? I do not care if it	s
not you ? But it WAS said , I know , very well , and by more than one ; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect Mr . Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all ; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself . And besides that , my cousin Richard said himself , that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr . Ferrars would be off ; and	s
in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . So then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . And just then I could not hear any more , for my cousin called from	s
her .-- My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , " I am , & c ." As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer ' s real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs . Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise .	s
" Very well indeed !-- how prettily she writes !-- aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . That was just like Lucy .-- Poor soul ! I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart .-- She calls me dear Mrs . Jennings , you see . She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived .-- Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough . How attentive she is , to think of every body !-- Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me . It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy ' s head and heart great credit ." CHAPTER 39 The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne ' s impatience to be gone increased every day . She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it .	l
Mrs . Jennings ' s address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled --" for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers ;-- and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back !-- Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats ." Perhaps Mrs . Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it ;-- and if so ,	s
calm voice ,-- " I am afraid it cannot take place very soon ." Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , " Lord ! what should hinder it ?"-- but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . " This is very strange !-- sure he need not wait to be older ." This delay on the Colonel ' s side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs . Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , " I shall always think myself very much obliged to you ." Mrs . Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply !-- She had not thought her old friend	l
and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment .-- Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair . " Mrs . Jennings told me ," said he , " that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so -- or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such	s
-- I would express it if I could -- but , as you well know , I am no orator ." " You are very much mistaken . I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon ' s discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his	s
, and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house ,) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this ." Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . " Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St . James Street ,"	s
alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I sha ' nt go if Lucy an ' t there ." Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . CHAPTER 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett ' s Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs . Jennings , who called on her	s
I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time ." " You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs . Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world ." Elinor was silent . " We think NOW ,"-- said Mr . Dashwood , after a short pause , " of ROBERT ' S marrying Miss Morton ." Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother ' s tone , calmly replied , " The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair ." " Choice !-- how do	s
you mean ?" " I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert ." " Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son ;-- and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other ." Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent .-- His reflections ended thus . " Of ONE thing , my dear sister ," kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper ,--" I may assure you ;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you . I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs . Ferrars	l
ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty .-- I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on . I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ' My dear fellow ,' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your	l
; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel . But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began .-- Towards the evening Marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before . Her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected	s
alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr . Harris , and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother . To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing - room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present . It was no time for hesitation . Her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him . Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of :-- he listened to them in silent despondence ;-- but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs . Dashwood . Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome . She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and	l
her care , and she was known to have been greatly injured , and long unhappy . The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her ;-- and as for their mother , when Mrs . Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere . Mr . Harris was punctual in his second visit ;-- but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce . His medicines had failed ;-- the fever was unabated ; and Marianne only more quiet -- not more herself -- remained in a heavy stupor . Elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice . But he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood . She was calm , except when she thought	l
letters and sleep . The night was cold and stormy . The wind roared round the house , and the rain beat against the windows ; but Elinor , all happiness within , regarded it not . Marianne slept through every blast ; and the travellers -- they had a rich reward in store , for every present inconvenience . The clock struck eight . Had it been ten , Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house ; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID , in	s
from the servant . God be praised !-- But is it true ? is it really true ?" Elinor would not speak . He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness . " For God ' s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ?" " We hope she is ." He rose up , and walked across the room . " Had I known as much half an hour ago -- But since I AM here ,"-- speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat --" what does it signify ?-- For once , Miss Dashwood -- it will be the last time , perhaps -- let us be cheerful together .-- I am in a fine mood for gaiety .-- Tell me honestly "-- a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks -- " do you think me most a knave or a fool ?" Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever . She began to think that be must be in liquor ;-- the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose	l
more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at . " Yes ,-- I left London this morning at eight o ' clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough ." The steadiness of his manner , and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke , convincing Elinor , that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland , he was not brought there by intoxication , she said , after a moment ' s recollection , " Mr . Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse .-- What is it , that you mean by it ?"-- " I mean ,"-- said he , with serious energy --" if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW . I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart	l
to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister ." " Is this the real reason of your coming ?" " Upon my soul it is ,"-- was his answer , with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance , and in spite of herself made her think him sincere . " If that is all , you may be satisfied already ,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has	s
when I looked forward every thing so inviting !-- when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing !-- oh , it was a blessed journey !" He stopped . " Well , sir ," said Elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , " and this is all ?" " Ah !-- no ,-- have you forgot what passed in town ?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ?" " Yes , I saw every note that passed ." " When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time ,) what I felt is -- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion -- my feelings were very , very painful .-- Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart . To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt .-- Thunderbolts and daggers	l
!-- what a reproof would she have given me !-- her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own ,-- and I am sure they are dearer ." Elinor ' s heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again ;-- yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . " This is not right , Mr . Willoughby .-- Remember that you are married . Relate only what in your conscience you think	s
necessary for me to hear ." " Marianne ' s note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married .'-- But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world ,	l
was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence ,-- the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me ." " You are very wrong , Mr . Willoughby , very blamable ," said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; " you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs . Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience ." " Do not talk to me of my wife ," said he with a heavy sigh .-- " She does not deserve your compassion .-- She knew I had no regard for her when we married .-- Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy ,	l
heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have made it worse ." " Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you ?-- Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . You tell me that she has forgiven me already . Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever ." " I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness ." " Last night , in Drury Lane	l
lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me .-- That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly	s
morning I was in my carriage . Now you know all ." Elinor made no answer . Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper . The world had made him extravagant and vain -- Extravagance and vanity had made him cold -	s
dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . " At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me ," added Mrs . Dashwood , " even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability ,-- for I hear it is a large village ,-- indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation ." Poor Elinor !-- here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford !-- but her spirit was stubborn . " His fortune	s
too !-- for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT ;-- and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one ." Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby . CHAPTER 46 Marianne ' s illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother ' s presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into Mrs . Palmer ' s dressing - room . When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her . His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks	l
skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs . Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel ' s behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . At the end of another day or two , Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours , Mrs . Dashwood , urged equally by her own and her daughter ' s wishes , began to talk of removing to Barton . On HER measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs . Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ' stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable . At his and Mrs . Jennings ' s united request in return , Mrs . Dashwood was prevailed on to accept	l
." Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self - control . Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity . Willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister ' s health were more secure , before she appointed it . But the resolution was made only to be broken . Marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out . But at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter ' s wishes and the mother ' s confidence ; and Marianne , leaning on Elinor ' s	l
arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house . The sisters set out at a pace , slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required ;-- and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill , the important hill behind , when pausing with her eyes turned towards it , Marianne calmly said , " There , exactly there ,"-- pointing with one hand , " on that projecting mound ,--	s
had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died ,-- it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery ,-- wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died ,-- in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister !-- You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart !-- How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance !-- My mother too ! How could you have consoled her !-- I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs . Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt	l
countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater . But it was neither in Elinor ' s power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby ' s deserts ;-- she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray . In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again ;-- but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour , as she spoke ,-- and her unsteady voice , plainly shewed . " I wish to assure you both ," said she , " that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do ." Mrs . Dashwood would have	l
have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this .-- I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings ." " I know it -- I know it ," cried her mother . " Happy with a man of libertine practices !-- With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men !-- No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man !-- Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt ." Marianne sighed , and repeated , " I wish for no change ." " You consider the matter ," said Elinor , " exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments ,	l
, satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ' s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , " One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby ' s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents ." Marianne assented most feelingly	s
Lucy , the active , contriving manager , uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality , and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices ;-- pursuing her own interest in every thought , courting the favour of Colonel Brandon , of Mrs . Jennings , and of every wealthy friend . In Edward -- she knew not what she saw , nor what she wished to see ;-- happy or unhappy ,-- nothing pleased her ; she turned away her head from every sketch of him . Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars ,-- but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings . Though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend . They were all thoughtless or indolent . " When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma ' am ?" was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on . " I wrote to him , my love , last week ,	l
on him . He coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said ,-- " Perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean Mrs .-- Mrs . ROBERT Ferrars ." " Mrs . Robert Ferrars !"-- was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ;-- and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder . He rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice , " Perhaps you do not know -- you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to -- to the youngest -- to Miss Lucy Steele ." His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor , who sat with her head leaning over her work , in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was . "	l
his lady , engaged her mother ' s consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men . His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits . He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love ;-- and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire . He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness ;-- and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the	l
philosophic dignity of twenty - four . " It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side ," said he , " the consequence of ignorance of the world -- and want of employment . Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr . Pratt , I think -- nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had	s
, every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been ,-- saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be ,-- she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity ;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of	s
by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy ' s letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon	s
, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions -- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a	l
entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income . But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs . Ferrars ' s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert ' s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny . About four days after Edward ' s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared ,	s
enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy ' s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family .-- He thus continued : " Mrs . Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward ' s name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a	s
imprudent in HER eyes as the first ." He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour .-- " And if they really DO interest themselves ," said Marianne , in her new character of candour , " in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit ." After a visit on Colonel Brandon ' s side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together .-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on	l
he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son ,	s
he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward ' s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny . It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs . Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more . With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor ,	l
as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn . The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion - house ; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage , and direct every thing as they liked on the spot ;-- could chuse papers , project shrubberies , and invent a sweep . Mrs . Jennings ' s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she	s
thing is in such respectable and excellent condition !-- and his woods !-- I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger !-- And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him -- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody	s
She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another !-- and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married ,-- and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat ! But so it was . Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting ,-- instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on ,-- she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village . Colonel Brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to	l
after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good . 1 : 26 And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth . 1 : 27 So God created man in his	s
of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens , 2 : 5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground . 2 : 6 But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground . 2 : 7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul . 2 : 8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed . 2 : 9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree	l
unto Noah , Come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation . 7 : 2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female . 7 : 3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth . 7 : 4 For yet seven days ,	s
seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried . 8 : 15 And God spake unto Noah , saying , 8 : 16 Go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ' wives with thee . 8 : 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be	s
, and in their nations . 10 : 21 Unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born . 10 : 22 The children of Shem ; Elam , and Asshur , and Arphaxad , and Lud , and Aram . 10 : 23 And the children of Aram ; Uz , and Hul , and Gether , and Mash . 10 : 24 And Arphaxad begat Salah ; and Salah begat Eber . 10 : 25 And unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother ' s name was Joktan . 10 : 26 And Joktan begat Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth , and Jerah , 10 : 27 And Hadoram , and Uzal , and Diklah , 10 : 28 And Obal , and Abimael , and Sheba , 10 : 29 And Ophir , and Havilah , and Jobab : all these were the sons of Joktan . 10 : 30 And their dwelling was from Mesha , as thou	l
And Serug lived thirty years , and begat Nahor : 11 : 23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years , and begat sons and daughters . 11 : 24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years , and begat Terah : 11 : 25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years , and begat sons and daughters . 11 : 26 And Terah lived seventy years , and begat Abram , Nahor , and Haran . 11 : 27 Now these are the generations of Terah : Terah begat Abram ,	s
Nahor , and Haran ; and Haran begat Lot . 11 : 28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity , in Ur of the Chaldees . 11 : 29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram ' s wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor ' s wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah . 11 : 30 But Sarai was barren ; she had no child . 11 : 31 And Terah took Abram his son , and Lot the son of Haran his son ' s son , and Sarai his daughter in law , his son Abram ' s wife ; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Haran , and dwelt there . 11 : 32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years : and Terah died in Haran . 12 : 1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram , Get thee out of thy country , and	l
Lot went with him : and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran . 12 : 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife , and Lot his brother ' s son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came . 12 : 6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem , unto the plain of Moreh . And the Canaanite was then in the land . 12 : 7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram , and said , Unto thy seed will I give this land : and there builded he an altar unto the LORD , who appeared unto him . 12 : 8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west , and Hai on the east : and there he builded an altar unto the LORD , and called upon the name of the LORD . 12 :	l
between my herdmen and thy herdmen ; for we be brethren . 13 : 9 Is not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , I pray thee , from me : if thou wilt take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then I will go to the left . 13 : 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of Jordan , that it was well watered every where , before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah ,	s
to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer , and of the kings that were with him , at the valley of Shaveh , which is the king ' s dale . 14 : 18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was the priest of the most high God . 14 : 19 And he blessed him , and said , Blessed be Abram of the most high God , possessor of heaven and earth : 14 : 20 And blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered	s
, Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be . 15 : 6 And he believed in the LORD ; and he counted it to him for righteousness . 15 : 7 And he said unto him , I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it . 15 : 8 And he said , LORD God , whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it ? 15 : 9 And he said unto him , Take me an heifer of three years old , and a she goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon . 15 : 10 And he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not . 15 : 11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases , Abram drove them away . 15 : 12	l
with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant . 17 : 14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised , that soul shall be cut off from his people ; he hath broken my covenant . 17 : 15 And God said unto Abraham , As for Sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name Sarai , but Sarah shall her name be . 17 : 16 And I will bless her , and give thee a son also	s
of her : yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her . 17 : 17 Then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ? 17 : 18 And Abraham said unto God , O that Ishmael might live before thee ! 17 : 19 And God said , Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him . 17 : 20 And as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : Behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation . 17 : 21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac , which Sarah shall bear unto thee at	l
in the flesh of his foreskin . 17 : 25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin . 17 : 26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised , and Ishmael his son . 17 : 27 And all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him . 18 : 1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ; 18 : 2 And he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself toward the ground , 18 : 3 And said , My LORD , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant : 18 : 4 Let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet ,	l
and rest yourselves under the tree : 18 : 5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . And they said , So do , as thou hast said . 18 : 6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah , and said , Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes upon the hearth . 18 : 7 And Abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a	s
came two angels to Sodom at even ; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom : and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ; 19 : 2 And he said , Behold now , my lords , turn in , I pray you , into your servant ' s house , and tarry all night , and wash your feet , and ye shall rise up early , and go on your ways . And they said , Nay ; but we will abide in the street all night . 19 : 3 And he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did bake unleavened bread , and they did eat . 19 : 4 But before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter : 19 : 5 And they called unto Lot , and said unto him , Where are the	l
earth when Lot entered into Zoar . 19 : 24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven ; 19 : 25 And he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground . 19 : 26 But his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt . 19 : 27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD : 19 : 28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace . 19 : 29 And it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt . 19 : 30 And Lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in	l
: thus she was reproved . 20 : 17 So Abraham prayed unto God : and God healed Abimelech , and his wife , and his maidservants ; and they bare children . 20 : 18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech , because of Sarah Abraham ' s wife . 21 : 1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said , and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken . 21 : 2 For Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age	s
: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac . 21 : 11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham ' s sight because of his son . 21 : 12 And God said unto Abraham , Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee , hearken unto her voice ; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called . 21 : 13 And also of the son of the bondwoman	s
Arise , lift up the lad , and hold him in thine hand ; for I will make him a great nation . 21 : 19 And God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink . 21 : 20 And God was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer . 21 : 21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a	s
and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence . 24 : 8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again . 24 : 9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and sware to him concerning that matter . 24 : 10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor . 24 : 11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water . 24 : 12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master Abraham . 24 : 13 Behold , I stand here by the well of water ;	l
' s feet that were with him . 24 : 33 And there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , I will not eat , until I have told mine errand . And he said , Speak on . 24 : 34 And he said , I am Abraham ' s servant . 24 : 35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses . 24 : 36 And Sarah my master ' s wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath . 24 : 37 And my master made me swear , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell : 24 : 38 But thou shalt go unto my father ' s house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son . 24 : 39	l
And I said unto my master , Peradventure the woman will not follow me . 24 : 40 And he said unto me , The LORD , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father ' s house : 24 : 41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath	s
24 : 57 And they said , We will call the damsel , and enquire at her mouth . 24 : 58 And they called Rebekah , and said unto her , Wilt thou go with this man ? And she said , I will go . 24 : 59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and Abraham ' s servant , and his men . 24 : 60 And they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them . 24 : 61 And Rebekah arose , and her damsels , and they rode upon the camels , and followed the man : and the servant took Rebekah , and went his way . 24 : 62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi ; for he dwelt in the south country . 24 : 63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels	l
that is before Egypt , as thou goest toward Assyria : and he died in the presence of all his brethren . 25 : 19 And these are the generations of Isaac , Abraham ' s son : Abraham begat Isaac : 25 : 20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram , the sister to Laban the Syrian . 25 : 21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife , because she was barren : and the LORD was intreated of him , and	s
he feared to say , She is my wife ; lest , said he , the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah ; because she was fair to look upon . 26 : 8 And it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife . 26 : 9 And Abimelech called Isaac , and said , Behold , of a surety she is thy wife ; and how saidst thou , She is my sister ? And Isaac said unto him , Because I said , Lest I die for her . 26 : 10 And Abimelech said , What is this thou hast done unto us ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us . 26 : 11 And Abimelech charged all his people , saying , He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death . 26 : 12 Then Isaac sowed in that land ,	l
16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac , Go from us ; for thou art much mightier than we . 26 : 17 And Isaac departed thence , and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar , and dwelt there . 26 : 18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water , which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father ; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them . 26 : 19 And Isaac ' s servants digged in the valley , and found there a well of springing water . 26 : 20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac ' s herdmen , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well Esek ; because they strove with him . 26 : 21 And they digged another well , and strove for that also : and he called the name of it Sitnah . 26 : 22 And he removed from thence , and digged another well ; and for that they strove not : and	l
in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace . 26 : 32 And it came to pass the same day , that Isaac ' s servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water . 26 : 33 And he called it Shebah : therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day . 26 : 34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith	s
venison , and to bring it . 27 : 6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son , saying , Behold , I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother , saying , 27 : 7 Bring me venison , and make me savoury meat , that I may eat , and bless thee before the LORD before my death . 27 : 8 Now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee . 27 : 9 Go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of	s
the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth : 27 : 10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death . 27 : 11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , Behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man : 27 : 12 My father peradventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing . 27 : 13 And his mother said unto him , Upon me be thy curse , my son : only obey my voice , and go fetch me them . 27 : 14 And he went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made savoury meat , such as his father loved . 27 : 15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jacob her younger son : 27	l
, thy firstborn Esau . 27 : 33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly , and said , Who ? where is he that hath taken venison , and brought it me , and I have eaten of all before thou camest , and have blessed him ? yea , and he shall be blessed . 27 : 34 And when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father . 27 : 35 And he	s
said , Thy brother came with subtilty , and hath taken away thy blessing . 27 : 36 And he said , Is not he rightly named Jacob ? for he hath supplanted me these two times : he took away my birthright ; and , behold , now he hath taken away my blessing . And he said , Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ? 27 : 37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau , Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ? 27 : 38 And Esau said unto his father , Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . And Esau lifted up his voice , and wept . 27 : 39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ; 27 : 40	l
not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan . 28 : 2 Arise , go to Padanaram , to the house of Bethuel thy mother ' s father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother ' s brother . 28 : 3 And God Almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ; 28 : 4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit	s
the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham . 28 : 5 And Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Padanaram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob ' s and Esau ' s mother . 28 : 6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob , and sent him away to Padanaram , to take him a wife from thence ; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan ; 28 : 7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Padanaram ; 28 : 8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father ; 28 : 9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham ' s son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife . 28 : 10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba , and went toward Haran . 28 : 11 And he lighted upon a	l
My brethren , whence be ye ? And they said , Of Haran are we . 29 : 5 And he said unto them , Know ye Laban the son of Nahor ? And they said , We know him . 29 : 6 And he said unto them , Is he well ? And they said , He is well : and , behold , Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep . 29 : 7 And he said , Lo , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together	s
her week , and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years . 29 : 28 And Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also . 29 : 29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid . 29 : 30 And he went in also unto Rachel , and he loved also Rachel more than Leah , and served with him yet seven other years . 29 : 31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated , he opened her womb : but Rachel was barren . 29 : 32 And Leah conceived , and bare a son , and she called his name Reuben : for she said , Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love me . 29 : 33 And she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , Because the LORD hath heard I was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon . 29	l
of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah . Then Rachel said to Leah , Give me , I pray thee , of thy son ' s mandrakes . 30 : 15 And she said unto her , Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son ' s mandrakes also ? And Rachel said , Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son ' s mandrakes . 30 : 16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Leah went out to meet him , and said , Thou must come in unto me ; for surely I have hired thee with my son ' s mandrakes . And he lay with her that night . 30 : 17 And God hearkened unto Leah , and she conceived , and bare Jacob the fifth son . 30 : 18 And Leah said , God hath given me my hire , because I have given my maiden to my husband : and she called his name Issachar . 30 : 19 And Leah	l
wages ten times ; but God suffered him not to hurt me . 31 : 8 If he said thus , The speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he said thus , The ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstraked . 31 : 9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father , and given them to me . 31 : 10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , behold , the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked , speckled , and grisled . 31 : 11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream , saying , Jacob : And I said , Here am I . 31 : 12 And he said , Lift up now thine eyes , and see , all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked , speckled , and grisled : for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee . 31 : 13 I am the God	l
of Bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred . 31 : 14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him , Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father ' s house ? 31 : 15 Are we not counted of him strangers ? for he hath sold us , and hath quite devoured also our money . 31 : 16 For all the riches which God	s
unawares to me , and carried away my daughters , as captives taken with the sword ? 31 : 27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from me ; and didst not tell me , that I might have sent thee away with mirth , and with songs , with tabret , and with harp ? 31 : 28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing . 31 : 29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight , saying , Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad . 31 : 30 And now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father ' s house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ? 31 : 31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me . 31 : 32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods	l
my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night . 31 : 40 Thus I was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes . 31 : 41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house ; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters , and six years for thy cattle : and thou hast changed my wages ten times . 31 : 42 Except the God of my father , the God of Abraham ,	s
: 6 And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , We came to thy brother Esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred men with him . 32 : 7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ; 32 : 8 And said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape . 32 : 9 And Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which saidst unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee : 32 : 10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto thy servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands . 32 : 11 Deliver me , I pray thee ,	l
sent them over the brook , and sent over that he had . 32 : 24 And Jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day . 32 : 25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob ' s thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him . 32 : 26 And he said , Let me go , for the day breaketh . And he said , I will not let thee go , except thou bless me . 32 : 27 And he said unto him , What is thy name ? And he said , Jacob . 32 : 28 And he said , Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed . 32 : 29 And Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . And he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name	l
some of the folk that are with me . And he said , What needeth it ? let me find grace in the sight of my lord . 33 : 16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir . 33 : 17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth , and built him an house , and made booths for his cattle : therefore the name of the place is called Succoth . 33 : 18 And Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from	s
and make there an altar unto God , that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother . 35 : 2 Then Jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments : 35 : 3 And let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the	s
way which I went . 35 : 4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem . 35 : 5 And they journeyed : and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob . 35 : 6 So Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him . 35 : 7 And he built there an altar , and called the place Elbethel : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother . 35 : 8 But Deborah Rebekah ' s nurse died , and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak : and the name of it was called Allonbachuth . 35 : 9 And God appeared unto Jacob again , when he came out of Padanaram , and blessed him . 35 : 10 And God said	l
beasts , and all his substance , which he had got in the land of Canaan ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob . 36 : 7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together ; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle . 36 : 8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir : Esau is Edom . 36 : 9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir : 36 : 10 These are the names of Esau ' s sons ; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau , Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau . 36 : 11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman , Omar , Zepho , and Gatam , and Kenaz . 36 : 12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau ' s son ; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek : these were the sons of Adah Esau ' s wife . 36 : 13 And these are the sons of Reuel ; Nahath , and Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah	l
dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom ; these were the sons of Adah . 36 : 17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau ' s son ; duke Nahath , duke Zerah , duke Shammah , duke Mizzah : these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau ' s wife . 36 : 18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau ' s wife ; duke Jeush , duke Jaalam , duke Korah : these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau ' s wife . 36 : 19 These are the sons of Esau , who is Edom , and these are their dukes . 36 : 20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite , who inhabited the land ; Lotan , and Shobal , and Zibeon , and Anah , 36 : 21 And Dishon , and Ezer , and Dishan : these are the dukes of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom . 36 : 22 And the children of Lotan were Hori	l
it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be thy son ' s coat or no . 37 : 33 And he knew it , and said , It is my son ' s coat ; an evil beast hath devoured him ; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces . 37 : 34 And Jacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days . 37 : 35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted ; and he said , For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning . Thus his father wept for him . 37 : 36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh ' s , and captain of the guard . 38 : 1 And it came to pass at that time , that Judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah . 38 : 2 And Judah saw there a daughter	l
Er his firstborn , whose name was Tamar . 38 : 7 And Er , Judah ' s firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD slew him . 38 : 8 And Judah said unto Onan , Go in unto thy brother ' s wife , and marry her , and raise up seed to thy brother . 38 : 9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother ' s wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother . 38 : 10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD : wherefore he slew him also . 38 : 11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law , Remain a widow at thy father ' s house , till Shelah my son be grown : for he said , Lest peradventure he die also , as his brethren did . And Tamar went and dwelt in her father ' s house . 38 : 12 And in process of time the daughter	l
of his lord ' s house , saying , Wherefore look ye so sadly to day ? 40 : 8 And they said unto him , We have dreamed a dream , and there is no interpreter of it . And Joseph said unto them , Do not interpretations belong to God ? tell me them , I pray you . 40 : 9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ; 40 : 10 And in the vine were three	s
branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes : 40 : 11 And Pharaoh ' s cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh ' s cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh ' s hand . 40 : 12 And Joseph said unto him , This is the interpretation of it : The three branches are three days : 40 : 13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto thy place : and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh ' s cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his butler . 40 : 14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house : 40 : 15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews : and here also have I done nothing that they should put	l
3 And , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river . 41 : 4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine . So Pharaoh awoke . 41 : 5 And he slept and dreamed the second time : and , behold , seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk , rank and good . 41 : 6 And , behold , seven thin ears	s
and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them . 41 : 7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears . And Pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream . 41 : 8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh . 41 : 9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh , saying , I do remember my faults this day : 41 : 10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the captain of the guard ' s house , both me and the chief baker : 41 : 11 And we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream . 41 : 12 And there was there with us a young man , an Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and	l
: and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread . 41 : 55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread : and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians , Go unto Joseph ; what he saith to you , do . 41 : 56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt . 41 : 57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn ; because that the famine was so sore in all lands . 42 : 1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt , Jacob said unto his sons , Why do ye look one upon another ? 42 : 2 And he said , Behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die . 42 : 3 And Joseph	l
would not hear ? therefore , behold , also his blood is required . 42 : 23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter . 42 : 24 And he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes . 42 : 25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man ' s money into his sack , and to	s
are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffick in the land . 42 : 35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man ' s bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid . 42 : 36 And Jacob their father said unto them , Me have ye bereaved of my children : Joseph is not , and Simeon is not , and ye will take Benjamin away : all these things are against me . 42 : 37 And Reuben spake unto his father , saying , Slay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again . 42 : 38 And he said , My son shall not go down with you ; for his brother is dead , and he is left alone : if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow	l
us , we will go down and buy thee food : 43 : 5 But if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you . 43 : 6 And Israel said , Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me , as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ? 43 : 7 And they said , The man asked us straitly of our state , and of our kindred , saying , Is your father yet alive ? have ye another brother ? and we told him according to the tenor of these words : could we certainly know that he would say , Bring your brother down ? 43 : 8 And Judah said unto Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones . 43 : 9 I will be surety for him ; of my hand shalt thou require him : if	l
afraid , because they were brought into Joseph ' s house ; and they said , Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in ; that he may seek occasion against us , and fall upon us , and take us for bondmen , and our asses . 43 : 19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph ' s house , and they communed with him at the door of the house , 43 : 20 And said , O sir , we came indeed down at	s
the first time to buy food : 43 : 21 And it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man ' s money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand . 43 : 22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food : we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks . 43 : 23 And he said , Peace be to you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father , hath given you treasure in your sacks : I had your money . And he brought Simeon out unto them . 43 : 24 And the man brought the men into Joseph ' s house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender . 43 : 25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon : for they heard that they should eat bread there . 43 : 26 And when Joseph	l
age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him . 44 : 21 And thou saidst unto thy servants , Bring him down unto me , that I may set mine eyes upon him . 44 : 22 And we said unto my lord , The lad cannot leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . 44 : 23 And thou saidst unto thy servants , Except your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more . 44 : 24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father , we told him the words of my lord . 44 : 25 And our father said , Go again , and buy us a little food . 44 : 26 And we said , We cannot go down : if our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down : for we may not see the man ' s face , except our youngest brother be with us . 44	l
us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad ' s life ; 44 : 31 It shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad is not with us , that he will die : and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave . 44 : 32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father , saying , If I bring him not unto thee , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever . 44 : 33 Now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren . 44 : 34 For how shall I go up to my father , and the lad be not with me ? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father . 45 : 1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . And there stood no	l
wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come . 45 : 20 Also regard not your stuff ; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your ' s . 45 : 21 And the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way . 45 : 22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave	s
three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment . 45 : 23 And to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way . 45 : 24 So he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way . 45 : 25 And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father , 45 : 26 And told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . And Jacob ' s heart fainted , for he believed them not . 45 : 27 And they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived : 45 : 28 And Israel said , It is enough ; Joseph my son	l
is yet alive : I will go and see him before I die . 46 : 1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Beersheba , and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac . 46 : 2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night , and said , Jacob , Jacob . And he said , Here am I . 46 : 3 And he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for	s
of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him . 46 : 21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah , and Becher , and Ashbel , Gera , and Naaman , Ehi , and Rosh , Muppim , and Huppim , and Ard . 46 : 22 These are the sons of Rachel , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen . 46 : 23 And the sons of Dan ; Hushim . 46 : 24 And the sons of Naphtali ; Jahzeel , and Guni , and Jezer , and Shillem . 46 : 25	s
from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth . 48 : 13 And Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel ' s left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel ' s right hand , and brought them near unto him . 48 : 14 And Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon Ephraim ' s head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh ' s head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was	s
great : but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his seed shall become a multitude of nations . 48 : 20 And he blessed them that day , saying , In thee shall Israel bless , saying , God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh : and he set Ephraim before Manasseh . 48 : 21 And Israel said unto Joseph , Behold , I die : but God shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers . 48 : 22 Moreover I have given to thee	s
of the tribes of Israel . 49 : 17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way , an adder in the path , that biteth the horse heels , so that his rider shall fall backward . 49 : 18 I have waited for thy salvation , O LORD . 49 : 19 Gad , a troop shall overcome him : but he shall overcome at the last . 49 : 20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainties . 49 : 21 Naphtali is a hind let loose : he	s
in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace . 49 : 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife ; and there I buried Leah . 49 : 32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth . 49 : 33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people . 50 : 1 And Joseph fell upon his father ' s face , and wept upon him , and kissed him . 50 : 2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father : and the physicians embalmed Israel . 50 : 3 And forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed : and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days . 50 : 4	l
s mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the LORD ? 4 : 12 Now therefore go , and I will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say . 4 : 13 And he said , O my LORD , send , I pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send . 4 : 14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . And also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart . 4 : 15 And thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do . 4 : 16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead	l
land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw . 5 : 13 And the taskmasters hasted them , saying , Fulfil your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw . 5 : 14 And the officers of the children of Israel , which Pharaoh ' s taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ? 5 : 15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh , saying	s
: 6 : 7 And I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians . 6 : 8 And I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the LORD . 6 : 9 And Moses	s
spake so unto the children of Israel : but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage . 6 : 10 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 6 : 11 Go in , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land . 6 : 12 And Moses spake before the LORD , saying , Behold , the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me ; how then shall Pharaoh hear me , who am of uncircumcised lips ? 6 : 13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt . 6 : 14 These be the heads of their fathers ' houses : The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel ; Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi : these be the families of Reuben . 6 : 15 And the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and	l
: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years . 6 : 19 And the sons of Merari ; Mahali and Mushi : these are the families of Levi according to their generations . 6 : 20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father ' s sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years . 6 : 21 And the sons of Izhar ; Korah , and Nepheg , and Zichri . 6 : 22 And the sons of Uzziel ; Mishael , and Elzaphan , and Zithri . 6 : 23 And Aaron took him Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Naashon , to wife ; and she bare him Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar . 6 : 24 And the sons of Korah ; Assir , and Elkanah , and Abiasaph : these are the families of the Korhites . 6 : 25 And Eleazar Aaron ' s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas	l
out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt . 8 : 18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast . 8 : 19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh , This is the finger of God : and Pharaoh ' s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said . 8 : 20 And the LORD said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Let my people go , that they may serve me . 8 : 21 Else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people , and into	l
thy houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are . 8 : 22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth . 8 : 23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be . 8 : 24 And	s
go out from thee , and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , to morrow : but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD . 8 : 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh , and intreated the LORD . 8 : 31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people	s
upon thine heart , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth . 9 : 15 For now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth . 9 : 16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth . 9 :	s
yet fear the LORD God . 9 : 31 And the flax and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled . 9 : 32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten : for they were not grown up . 9 : 33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth . 9 : 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the	s
rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants . 9 : 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of Israel go ; as the LORD had spoken by Moses . 10 : 1 And the LORD said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh : for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might shew these my signs before him : 10 : 2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son , and of thy son ' s son , what things I have wrought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the LORD . 10 : 3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me . 10 : 4 Else , if thou	l
; for evil is before you . 10 : 11 Not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the LORD ; for that ye did desire . And they were driven out from Pharaoh ' s presence . 10 : 12 And the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left . 10 : 13 And Moses stretched forth his	s
rod over the land of Egypt , and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts . 10 : 14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such . 10 : 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth , so that the land was darkened ; and they did eat every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left : and there remained not any green thing in the trees , or in the herbs of the field , through all the land of Egypt . 10 : 16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste ; and he said , I have sinned against the LORD your God , and against you . 10 : 17 Now therefore forgive , I pray thee , my sin only this once	l
, such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more . 11 : 7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel . 11 : 8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go	s
out . And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger . 11 : 9 And the LORD said unto Moses , Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt . 11 : 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh : and the LORD hardened Pharaoh ' s heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land . 12 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying , 12 : 2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you . 12 : 3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house : 12 : 4 And if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of	l
the LORD . 12 : 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt . 12 : 14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever . 12 : 15 Seven	s
that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning . 12 : 23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the LORD will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you . 12 : 24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever . 12 : 25 And it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service . 12 : 26 And it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , What mean ye by this service ? 12 : 27 That ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the LORD ' s passover , who passed	l
, let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that is born in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof . 12 : 49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you . 12 : 50 Thus did all the children of Israel ; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they . 12 : 51 And it came to pass the selfsame day , that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies . 13 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 13 : 2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine . 13 : 3 And Moses said unto the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place	l
: there shall no leavened bread be eaten . 13 : 4 This day came ye out in the month Abib . 13 : 5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month . 13 : 6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the	s
and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the LORD ' s . 13 : 13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break his neck : and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem . 13 : 14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What is this ? that thou shalt say unto him , By strength of hand the	s
harnessed out of the land of Egypt . 13 : 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him : for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you . 13 : 20 And they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wilderness . 13 : 21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by	s
sea ; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided . 14 : 22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left . 14 : 23 And the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh ' s horses , his chariots	s
, and his horsemen . 14 : 24 And it came to pass , that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians , 14 : 25 And took off their chariot wheels , that they drave them heavily : so that the Egyptians said , Let us flee from the face of Israel ; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians . 14 : 26 And the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen . 14 : 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea . 14 : 28 And the waters returned , and covered the chariots , and the horsemen , and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them ;	l
and believed the LORD , and his servant Moses . 15 : 1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea . 15 : 2 The LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father ' s God , and I will exalt him . 15 : 3 The LORD is a man of war : the LORD is his name . 15 : 4 Pharaoh ' s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea : his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea . 15 : 5 The depths have covered them : they sank into the bottom as a stone . 15 : 6 Thy right hand , O LORD , is become glorious in power : thy right hand , O LORD , hath dashed in pieces the enemy . 15 : 7 And in the greatness	l
her two sons ; of which the name of the one was Gershom ; for he said , I have been an alien in a strange land : 18 : 4 And the name of the other was Eliezer ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh : 18 : 5 And Jethro , Moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God : 18 : 6	s
mayest bring the causes unto God : 18 : 20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do . 18 : 21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens : 18 : 22 And let them judge the people	s
go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death : 19 : 13 There shall not an hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned , or shot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount . 19 : 14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes . 19 : 15 And he said unto the people , Be ready against the third day : come not at your wives . 19 : 16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled . 19 : 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the nether part of the	l
: 7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the menservants do . 21 : 8 If she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her . 21 : 9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters . 21 : 10 If he take	s
the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide . 21 : 36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own . 22 : 1 If a man shall steal an ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five oxen for an ox , and four sheep for a sheep . 22 : 2	s
with it , he shall surely make it good . 22 : 15 But if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be an hired thing , it came for his hire . 22 : 16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely endow her to be his wife . 22 : 17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins . 22 : 18	s
to their gods , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but thou shalt utterly overthrow them , and quite break down their images . 23 : 25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God , and he shall bless thy bread , and thy water ; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee . 23 : 26 There shall nothing cast their young , nor be barren , in thy land : the number of thy days I will fulfil . 23 : 27 I will send my fear before thee	s
gold : of beaten work shall the candlestick be made : his shaft , and his branches , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , shall be of the same . 25 : 32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side : 25 : 33 Three bowls made like unto almonds , with a knop and a flower in one branch ; and three bowls made like almonds in the	s
other branch , with a knop and a flower : so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick . 25 : 34 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds , with their knops and their flowers . 25 : 35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick . 25 : 36 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same : all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold . 25 : 37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it . 25 : 38 And the tongs thereof , and the snuffdishes thereof , shall be of pure gold . 25 : 39 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it , with all these vessels . 25 : 40 And look that thou make them after their pattern , which was	l
their hands upon the head of the bullock . 29 : 11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation . 29 : 12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock , and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger , and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar . 29 : 13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul that is above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and burn them upon the altar . 29 : 14 But the flesh of the bullock , and his skin , and his dung , shalt thou burn with fire without the camp : it is a sin offering . 29 : 15 Thou shalt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram . 29 : 16 And thou shalt slay the ram , and thou shalt take his blood , and sprinkle it round about upon the altar .	l
29 : 17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces , and wash the inwards of him , and his legs , and put them unto his pieces , and unto his head . 29 : 18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar : it is a burnt offering unto the LORD : it is a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the LORD . 29 : 19 And thou shalt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .	s
put them on seven days , when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place . 29 : 31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration , and seethe his flesh in the holy place . 29 : 32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram , and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation . 29 : 33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made , to consecrate and to sanctify them :	s
thou shalt offer in the morning ; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even : 29 : 40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering . 29 : 41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even , and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning , and according to the drink offering thereof , for a sweet savour , an offering made by fire	s
unto the LORD . 29 : 42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD : where I will meet you , to speak there unto thee . 29 : 43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel , and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory . 29 : 44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation , and the altar : I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the priest ' s office . 29 : 45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will be their God . 29 : 46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them : I am the LORD their God . 30 : 1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon : of shittim wood shalt thou make it . 30 : 2 A cubit shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the	l
people . 31 : 15 Six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the LORD : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death . 31 : 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant . 31 : 17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed . 31 : 18 And he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God . 32 : 1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount , the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron , and said unto him , Up , make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the	l
man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him . 32 : 2 And Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me . 32 : 3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron . 32 : 4 And he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a	s
thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen . 34 : 1 And the LORD said unto Moses , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest . 34 : 2 And be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount . 34 : 3 And no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount . 34 : 4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the LORD had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone . 34 : 5 And the LORD descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of the LORD . 34 : 6	l
And the LORD passed by before him , and proclaimed , The LORD , The LORD God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth , 34 : 7 Keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children ' s children , unto the third and to the fourth generation . 34 : 8 And Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and	s
onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod , and for the breastplate . 35 : 10 And every wise hearted among you shall come , and make all that the LORD hath commanded ; 35 : 11 The tabernacle , his tent , and his covering , his taches , and his boards , his bars , his pillars , and his sockets , 35 : 12 The ark , and the staves thereof , with the mercy seat , and the vail of the covering , 35 : 13 The table , and his staves , and all his vessels , and the shewbread , 35 : 14 The candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light , 35 : 15 And the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle , 35 : 16 The altar of burnt offering , with his brasen grate , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot , 35	l
. So the people were restrained from bringing . 36 : 7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much . 36 : 8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work made he them . 36 : 9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : the curtains were	s
And they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners . 36 : 30 And there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets . 36 : 31 And he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle , 36 : 32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards	s
. 37 : 4 And he made staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold . 37 : 5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark , to bear the ark . 37 : 6 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half was the length thereof , and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof . 37 : 7 And he made two cherubims of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mercy seat ; 37 : 8 One cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side : out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof . 37 : 9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims . 37 : 10 And he made the table of shittim wood : two cubits was the length	l
Over against the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table . 37 : 15 And he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table . 37 : 16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold . 37 : 17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same : 37 : 18 And six branches going out of the sides thereof ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof : 37 : 19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch , a knop and a flower ; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch , a knop and a flower : so throughout the six branches going	l
seven lamps , and his snuffers , and his snuffdishes , of pure gold . 37 : 24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof . 37 : 25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood : the length of it was a cubit , and the breadth of it a cubit ; it was foursquare ; and two cubits was the height of it ; the horns thereof were of the same . 37 : 26 And he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about . 37 : 27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal . 37 : 28 And he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold . 37 : 29 And he made the holy anointing oil , and the pure incense	l
, and light the lamps thereof . 40 : 5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony , and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle . 40 : 6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation . 40 : 7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein . 40 : 8 And thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the hanging at the court gate . 40 : 9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy . 40 : 10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering , and all his vessels , and sanctify the altar : and it shall be an altar most holy . 40 : 11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot , and sanctify	l
. 40 : 26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail : 40 : 27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon ; as the LORD commanded Moses . 40 : 28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle . 40 : 29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering ; as the LORD commanded Moses . 40 : 30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash withal . 40 : 31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat : 40 : 32 When they went into the tent of the congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the LORD commanded Moses . 40 : 33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . So Moses finished	l
, Aaron ' s sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the fat , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar : 1 : 9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water : and the priest shall burn all on the altar , to be a burnt sacrifice , an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD . 1 : 10 And if his offering be of the flocks , namely , of the sheep , or of the goats , for a burnt sacrifice ; he shall bring it a male without blemish . 1 : 11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron ' s sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar . 1 : 12 And he shall cut it into his pieces , with his head and his fat : and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar : 1 : 13 But he	l
sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards , 3 : 4 And the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away . 3 : 5 And Aaron ' s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire :	s
it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD . 3 : 6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock ; male or female , he shall offer it without blemish . 3 : 7 If he offer a lamb for his offering , then shall he offer it before the LORD . 3 : 8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron ' s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar . 3 : 9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat thereof , and the whole rump , it shall he take off hard by the backbone ; and the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards , 3 : 10 And the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver ,	l

congregation of Israel sin through ignorance , and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ; 4 : 14 When the sin , which they have sinned against it , is known , then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin , and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation . 4 : 15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD : and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD . 4 : 16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock ' s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation : 4 : 17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD , even before the vail . 4 : 18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD , that is in the tabernacle of the	l

priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin . 5 : 7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his trespass , which he hath committed , two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , unto the LORD ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering . 5 : 8 And he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder : 5 : 9 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar ; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar : it is a sin offering . 5 : 10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering , according to the manner : and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned , and it shall be forgiven him . 5 : 11 But if he be not able	l
much as another . 7 : 11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he shall offer unto the LORD . 7 : 12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving , then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and cakes mingled with oil , of fine flour , fried . 7 : 13 Besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings . 7 : 14	s
them upon the altar . 9 : 14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs , and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar . 9 : 15 And he brought the people ' s offering , and took the goat , which was the sin offering for the people , and slew it , and offered it for sin , as the first . 9 : 16 And he brought the burnt offering , and offered it according to the manner . 9 : 17 And he brought the meat offering , and took an	s

And they did according to the word of Moses . 10 : 8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron , saying , 10 : 9 Do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations : 10 : 10 And that ye	s
may put difference between holy and unholy , and between unclean and clean ; 10 : 11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses . 10 : 12 And Moses spake unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy : 10 : 13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place , because it is thy due , and thy sons ' due , of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire : for so I am commanded . 10 : 14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place ; thou , and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee : for they be thy due , and thy sons ' due , which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel . 10 : 15 The heave shoulder	l
: they are unclean unto you . 11 : 29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind , 11 : 30 And the ferret , and the chameleon , and the lizard , and the snail , and the mole . 11 : 31 These are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even . 11 : 32 And upon whatsoever any of them , when they are dead , doth fall , it shall be unclean ; whether it be any vessel of wood , or raiment , or skin , or sack , whatsoever vessel it be , wherein any work is done , it must be put into water , and it shall be unclean until the even ; so it shall be cleansed . 11 : 33 And every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean ; and ye shall break it . 11 : 34 Of all	l
carcase shall be unclean . 11 : 37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it shall be clean . 11 : 38 But if any water be put upon the seed , and any part of their carcase fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you . 11 : 39 And if any beast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even . 11 : 40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even . 11 : 41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination ; it shall not be eaten . 11 : 42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination . 11	l
ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy . 11 : 46 This is the law of the beasts , and of the fowl , and of every living creature that moveth in the waters , and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth : 11 : 47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten . 12 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 12 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean . 12 : 3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised . 12 : 4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days ; she shall touch no hallowed thing , nor come into the sanctuary , until the days of her purifying be fulfilled . 12 : 5	l
13 : 57 And if it appear still in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a spreading plague : thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire . 13 : 58 And the garment , either warp , or woof , or whatsoever thing of skin it be , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shall be clean . 13 : 59 This is the	s
head of him that is to be cleansed , to make an atonement for him before the LORD . 14 : 30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves , or of the young pigeons , such as he can get ; 14 : 31 Even such as he is able to get , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , with the meat offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD . 14 : 32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing . 14 : 33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , 14 : 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ; 14 : 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to	l
it is plaistered ; 14 : 44 Then the priest shall come and look , and , behold , if the plague be spread in the house , it is a fretting leprosy in the house ; it is unclean . 14 : 45 And he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the timber thereof , and all the morter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place . 14 : 46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it	s
man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be unclean seven days ; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean . 15 : 25 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation , or if it run beyond the time of her separation ; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation : she shall be unclean . 15 : 26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days	s
his finger seven times . 16 : 15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the vail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat : 16 : 16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place , because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel , and because of their transgressions in all their sins : and so shall he	s
of the congregation , and shall put off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there : 16 : 24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place , and put on his garments , and come forth , and offer his burnt offering , and the burnt offering of the people , and make an atonement for himself , and for the people . 16 : 25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar . 16 : 26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward come into the camp . 16 : 27 And the bullock for the sin offering , and the goat for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall burn in the fire their skins , and their flesh , and their dung . 16 : 28 And he that burneth them shall wash his	l
clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp . 16 : 29 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you : that in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , ye shall afflict your souls , and do no work at all , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger that sojourneth among you : 16 : 30 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you , to cleanse you , that ye may be	s
beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it is confusion . 18 : 24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you : 18 : 25 And the land is defiled : therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants . 18 : 26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you : 18 : 27 ( For all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ;) 18 : 28 That the land spue not you out also , when ye defile it , as it spued out the nations that were before you . 18 : 29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations , even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people . 18 :	l
thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the LORD your God . 19 : 11 Ye shall not steal , neither deal falsely , neither lie one to another . 19 : 12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely , neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God : I am the LORD . 19 : 13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour , neither rob him : the wages of him that is hired shall not abide	s
with thee all night until the morning . 19 : 14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf , nor put a stumblingblock before the blind , but shalt fear thy God : I am the LORD . 19 : 15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment : thou shalt not respect the person of the poor , nor honor the person of the mighty : but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour . 19 : 16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people : neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour ; I am the LORD . 19 : 17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart : thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour , and not suffer sin upon him . 19 : 18 Thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : I am the LORD . 19 : 19 Ye shall keep my statutes . Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed	l
And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done : and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him . 19 : 23 And when ye shall come into the land , and shall have planted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised : three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you : it shall not be eaten of . 19 : 24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal . 19 : 25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : I am the LORD your God . 19 : 26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood : neither shall ye use enchantment , nor observe times . 19 : 27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard . 19 : 28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your	l
And the man that committeth adultery with another man ' s wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour ' s wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death . 20 : 11 And the man that lieth with his father ' s wife hath uncovered his father ' s nakedness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . 20 : 12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death :	s
but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife . 21 : 15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people : for I the LORD do sanctify him . 21 : 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 21 : 17 Speak unto Aaron , saying , Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish , let him not approach to offer the bread of his God . 21 : 18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a	s
22 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 22 : 2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : I am the LORD . 22 : 3 Say unto them , Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations , that goeth unto the holy things , which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD , having his uncleanness upon him ,	s
them : they shall not be accepted for you . 22 : 26 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 22 : 27 When a bullock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , then it shall be seven days under the dam ; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD . 22 : 28 And whether it be cow , or ewe , ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day . 22 : 29	s
shall do no servile work therein . 23 : 8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days : in the seventh day is an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein . 23 : 9 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 23 : 10 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest : 23 : 11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it . 23 : 12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD . 23 : 13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil , an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour :	l
memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the LORD . 24 : 8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually , being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant . 24 : 9 And it shall be Aaron ' s and his sons '; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute . 24 : 10 And the son of an Israelitish woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ; 24 : 11 And the Israelitish woman ' s son blasphemed the name of the Lord , and cursed . And they brought him unto Moses : ( and his mother ' s name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan :) 24 : 12 And they put him in ward , that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them . 24 : 13	l
on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land . 25 : 10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family . 25 : 11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth	s
, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption . 25 : 53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him : and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight . 25 : 54 And if he be not redeemed in these years , then he shall go out in the year of jubile , both he , and his children with him . 25 : 55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth	s
out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God . 26 : 1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the LORD your God . 26 : 2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : I am the LORD . 26 : 3 If ye walk in my statutes , and keep my commandments , and do them ; 26 : 4 Then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit . 26 : 5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely . 26 : 6 And I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid	l

have no power to stand before your enemies . 26 : 38 And ye shall perish among the heathen , and the land of your enemies shall eat you up . 26 : 39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them . 26 : 40 If they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ; 26 : 41 And that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity : 26 : 42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob , and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land . 26 : 43 The land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sabbaths	l
covenant of their ancestors , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen , that I might be their God : I am the LORD . 26 : 46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws , which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses . 27 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 27 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When a man shall make a singular vow , the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation . 27 : 3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old , even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary . 27 : 4 And if it be a female , then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels . 27 : 5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old , then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels , and for the	l
of Judah , were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred . 1 : 28 Of the children of Issachar , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ; 1 : 29 Those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of Issachar , were fifty and four thousand and four hundred . 1 : 30 Of the children of Zebulun , by their generations ,	s
all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty . 1 : 47 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them . 1 : 48 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses , saying , 1 : 49 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi , neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel : 1 : 50 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony , and over all the vessels thereof , and over all things that belong to it : they shall bear the tabernacle , and all the vessels thereof ; and they shall minister unto it , and shall encamp round about the tabernacle . 1 : 51 And when the tabernacle setteth forward , the Levites shall take it down : and when the tabernacle is to be pitched , the Levites shall set it up : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death . 1 : 52 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents , every man by his own camp , and every man	l
by his own standard , throughout their hosts . 1 : 53 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony . 1 : 54 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses , so did they . 2 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , 2 : 2 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch	s
, from a month old and upward , were six thousand and two hundred . 3 : 35 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail : these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward . 3 : 36 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and the sockets thereof , and all the vessels thereof , and all that serveth thereto , 3	s
the word of the LORD , as the LORD commanded Moses . 4 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , 4 : 2 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi , after their families , by the house of their fathers , 4 : 3 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old , all that enter into the host , to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation . 4 : 4 This shall be the service of the sons	s
the service of the families of the sons of Merari , according to all their service , in the tabernacle of the congregation , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest . 4 : 34 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families , and after the house of their fathers , 4 : 35 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation :	s
and whosoever is defiled by the dead : 5 : 3 Both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell . 5 : 4 And the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the LORD spake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel . 5 : 5 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 5 : 6 Speak unto the children of Israel , When a man	s
mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consecration of his God is upon his head . 6 : 8 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD . 6 : 9 And if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seventh day shall he shave it . 6 : 10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : 6 : 11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day . 6 : 12 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days	l
that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled . 6 : 13 And this is the law of the Nazarite , when the days of his separation are fulfilled : he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : 6 : 14 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD , one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for peace offerings , 6	s
unto the Levites . 7 : 7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon , according to their service : 7 : 8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari , according unto their service , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest . 7 : 9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders . 7 : 10 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar . 7 : 11 And the LORD said unto Moses , They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedicating of the altar . 7 : 12 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah : 7 : 13 And his offering was one silver charger , the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy	l
this was the offering of Eliasaph the son of Deuel . 7 : 48 On the seventh day Elishama the son of Ammihud , prince of the children of Ephraim , offered : 7 : 49 His offering was one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering : 7 : 50 One golden spoon of ten shekels , full of incense : 7 : 51 One	s
oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur . 7 : 60 On the ninth day Abidan the son of Gideoni , prince of the children of Benjamin , offered : 7 : 61 His offering was one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering : 7 :	s
shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may execute the service of the LORD . 8 : 12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks : and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , unto the LORD , to make an atonement for the Levites . 8 : 13 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering unto the LORD	s
. 8 : 14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel : and the Levites shall be mine . 8 : 15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation : and thou shalt cleanse them , and offer them for an offering . 8 : 16 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel , have I taken them unto me . 8 : 17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself . 8 : 18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel . 8 : 19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel , to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the	l
LORD . 9 : 11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it , and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs . 9 : 12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it . 9 : 13 But the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and forbeareth to keep the passover , even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people : because	s
the journeying of the camps . 10 : 3 And when they shall blow with them , all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation . 10 : 4 And if they blow but with one trumpet , then the princes , which are heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves unto thee . 10 : 5 When ye blow an alarm , then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward . 10 : 6 When ye blow an alarm the second time ,	s
came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony . 10 : 12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran . 10 : 13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses . 10 : 14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according	s
: 35 And it came to pass , when the ark set forward , that Moses said , Rise up , LORD , and let thine enemies be scattered ; and let them that hate thee flee before thee . 10 : 36 And when it rested , he said , Return , O LORD , unto the many thousands of Israel . 11 : 1 And when the people complained , it displeased the LORD : and the LORD heard it ; and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them , and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp . 11 : 2 And the people cried unto Moses ; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD , the fire was quenched . 11 : 3 And he called the name of the place Taberah : because the fire of the LORD burnt among them . 11 : 4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting : and the children of Israel also wept again , and said , Who shall give us flesh to eat ? 11 : 5 We remember the fish	l
and Medad do prophesy in the camp . 11 : 28 And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of Moses , one of his young men , answered and said , My lord Moses , forbid them . 11 : 29 And Moses said unto him , Enviest thou for my sake ? would God that all the LORD ' s people were prophets , and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them ! 11 : 30 And Moses gat him into the camp , he and the elders of Israel . 11 : 31 And	s
, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation . And they three came out . 12 : 5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth . 12 : 6 And he said , Hear now my words : If there be a prophet among you , I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream . 12 : 7 My servant Moses is not so , who is faithful in all mine house . 12 : 8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ? 12 : 9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them ; and he departed . 12 : 10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , Miriam became leprous , white as snow :	l
son of Zaccur . 13 : 5 Of the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the son of Hori . 13 : 6 Of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh . 13 : 7 Of the tribe of Issachar , Igal the son of Joseph . 13 : 8 Of the tribe of Ephraim , Oshea the son of Nun . 13 : 9 Of the tribe of Benjamin , Palti the son of Raphu . 13 : 10 Of the tribe of Zebulun , Gaddiel the son of Sodi . 13 : 11 Of the tribe	s
Hebron ; where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were . ( Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt .) 13 : 23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs . 13 : 24 The place was called the brook Eshcol , because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence . 13 : 25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days . 13 : 26 And they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word unto them , and unto all the congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land . 13 : 27 And they told him , and said , We came unto the land whither thou sentest us , and surely it floweth	l
with milk and honey ; and this is the fruit of it . 13 : 28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land , and the cities are walled , and very great : and moreover we saw the children of Anak there . 13 : 29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the Hittites , and the Jebusites , and the Amorites , dwell in the mountains : and the Canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of Jordan . 13 : 30 And Caleb stilled the people	s
congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness ! 14 : 3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land , to fall by the sword , that our wives and our children should be a prey ? were it not better for us to return into Egypt ? 14 : 4 And they said one to another , Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt . 14 : 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell	s
on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel . 14 : 6 And Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes : 14 : 7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land . 14 : 8 If the LORD delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey . 14 : 9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the LORD is with us : fear them not . 14 : 10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones . And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel . 14 : 11 And the LORD said unto	l
said , Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD ? but it shall not prosper . 14 : 42 Go not up , for the LORD is not among you ; that ye be not smitten before your enemies . 14 : 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye are turned away from the LORD , therefore the LORD will not be with you . 14 : 44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and Moses , departed not out of the camp . 14 : 45 Then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah . 15 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 15 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you , 15 : 3 And will make an offering by	l
fire unto the LORD , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the LORD , of the herd or of the flock : 15 : 4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil . 15 : 5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with	s
the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb . 15 : 6 Or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil . 15 : 7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the LORD . 15 : 8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the LORD : 15 : 9 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil . 15 : 10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD . 15 : 11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid . 15 : 12 According to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do	l
congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the LORD . 15 : 16 One law and one manner shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you . 15 : 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 15 : 18 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land whither I bring you , 15 : 19 Then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD . 15 : 20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it . 15 : 21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations . 15 : 22 And if ye have erred , and not observed all these commandments , which the	l
sons of Eliab , and On , the son of Peleth , sons of Reuben , took men : 16 : 2 And they rose up before Moses , with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renown : 16 : 3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron , and said unto them , Ye take too much upon you , seeing all the congregation are holy , every one of them , and the LORD is among them : wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD ? 16 : 4 And when Moses heard it , he fell upon his face : 16 : 5 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company , saying , Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his , and who is holy ; and will cause him to come near unto him : even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him . 16 : 6 This do ; Take you censers , Korah , and all his	l
And Moses was very wroth , and said unto the LORD , Respect not thou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them . 16 : 16 And Moses said unto Korah , Be thou and all thy company before the LORD , thou , and they , and Aaron , to morrow : 16 : 17 And take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also	s
And they fell upon their faces . 16 : 46 And Moses said unto Aaron , Take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an atonement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the LORD ; the plague is begun . 16 : 47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people . 16 : 48 And he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed . 16 : 49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside them that died about the matter of Korah . 16 : 50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the plague was stayed . 17 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 17 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel ,	l
LORD shall die : shall we be consumed with dying ? 18 : 1 And the LORD said unto Aaron , Thou and thy sons and thy father ' s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood . 18 : 2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness . 18 : 3 And they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die . 18 : 4 And they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you . 18 : 5 And ye shall keep the charge	l
of the congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them . 20 : 7 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 20 : 8 Take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and Aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water , and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink . 20 : 9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD , as he commanded him . 20 : 10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them , Hear now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ? 20 : 11 And Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also . 20 : 12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron ,	l
, in the wilderness which is before Moab , toward the sunrising . 21 : 12 From thence they removed , and pitched in the valley of Zared . 21 : 13 From thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites : for Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites . 21 : 14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD , What he did in the Red sea , and in the brooks of Arnon , 21 : 15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar , and lieth upon the border of Moab . 21 : 16 And from thence they went to Beer : that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses , Gather the people together , and I will give them water . 21 : 17 Then Israel sang this song , Spring up , O well ; sing ye unto it : 21 : 18 The princes digged the well , the nobles of	l
the people digged it , by the direction of the lawgiver , with their staves . And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah : 21 : 19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel : and from Nahaliel to Bamoth : 21 : 20 And from Bamoth in the valley , that is in the country of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looketh toward Jeshimon . 21 : 21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , saying , 21 : 22 Let me pass through thy land : we will not turn into	s
, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho . 22 : 2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites . 22 : 3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel . 22 : 4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian , Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field . And Balak	s
23 : 13 And Balak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence . 23 : 14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar . 23 : 15 And he said unto Balak , Stand here by thy burnt offering , while I meet the LORD yonder . 23 : 16 And the LORD met Balaam , and put a word in his mouth , and said , Go again unto Balak , and say thus . 23 : 17 And when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . And Balak said unto him , What hath the LORD spoken ? 23 : 18 And he took up his parable , and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken	l
whose eyes are open hath said : 24 : 16 He hath said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open : 24 : 17 I shall see him , but not now : I shall behold him , but not nigh : there shall come a Star out of Jacob , and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel , and shall smite the corners of Moab , and destroy all the	s
And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand . 25 : 10 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 25 : 11 Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , while he was zealous for my sake among them , that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy . 25 : 12 Wherefore say , Behold , I give unto him my covenant of peace : 25 : 13 And he shall have it	s
, and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his God , and made an atonement for the children of Israel . 25 : 14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites . 25 : 15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Midian . 25 : 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 25 : 17 Vex the Midianites , and smite them : 25 : 18 For they vex you with their wiles , wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor , and in the matter of Cozbi , the daughter of a prince of Midian , their sister , which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor ' s sake . 26 : 1 And it came to pass after the plague , that	l
the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , saying , 26 : 2 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel , from twenty years old and upward , throughout their fathers ' house , all that are able to go to war in Israel . 26 : 3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho , saying , 26 : 4 Take the sum of the people , from twenty years old and upward ; as the	s
LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt . 26 : 5 Reuben , the eldest son of Israel : the children of Reuben ; Hanoch , of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites : of Pallu , the family of the Palluites : 26 : 6 Of Hezron , the family of the Hezronites : of Carmi , the family of the Carmites . 26 : 7 These are the families of the Reubenites : and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty . 26 : 8 And the sons of Pallu ; Eliab . 26 : 9 And the sons of Eliab ; Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . This is that Dathan and Abiram , which were famous in the congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against the LORD : 26 : 10 And the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died , what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men	l
Jordan near Jericho . 26 : 64 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered , when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai . 26 : 65 For the LORD had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness . And there was not left a man of them , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun . 27 : 1 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead	s

their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil : three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock , and two tenth deals for a ram ; 28 : 21 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb , throughout the seven lambs : 28 : 22 And one goat for a sin offering , to make an atonement for you . 28 : 23 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning , which is for a continual burnt offering . 28 : 24 After this manner ye shall offer daily ,	s

And the children of Israel removed from Rameses , and pitched in Succoth . 33 : 6 And they departed from Succoth , and pitched in Etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness . 33 : 7 And they removed from Etham , and turned again unto Pihahiroth , which is before Baalzephon : and they pitched before Migdol . 33 : 8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness , and went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and pitched in Marah . 33 : 9 And they removed from Marah , and came unto Elim : and in Elim were twelve fountains of water , and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they pitched there . 33 : 10 And they removed from Elim , and encamped by the Red sea . 33 : 11 And they removed from the Red sea , and encamped in the wilderness of Sin . 33 : 12 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin , and encamped in Dophkah . 33 : 13 And they departed from Dophkah	l

33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it . 35 : 34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit , wherein I dwell : for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel . 36 : 1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spake before Moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel : 36 : 2 And they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters . 36 : 3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel , then shall	l

The Fifth Book of Moses : Called Deuteronomy 1 : 1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the Red sea , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab . 1 : 2 ( There are eleven days ' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea .) 1 : 3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of Israel , according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them ; 1 : 4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites , which dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei : 1 : 5 On this side Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying , 1 : 6 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb , saying , Ye have	l
into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea . 1 : 41 Then ye answered and said unto me , We have sinned against the LORD , we will go up and fight , according to all that the LORD our God commanded us . And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war , ye were ready to go up into the hill . 1 : 42 And the LORD said unto me , Say unto them . Go not up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest ye	s
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host , as the LORD sware unto them . 2 : 15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consumed . 2 : 16 So it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people , 2 : 17 That the LORD spake unto me , saying , 2 : 18 Thou art to pass over through Ar , the coast of Moab , this day : 2 : 19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon , distress them not , nor meddle with them : for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession ; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession . 2 : 20 ( That also was accounted a land of giants : giants dwelt therein in old time ; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims ; 2 : 21 A people great , and many , and tall , as the	l

I have given you ; 3 : 20 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren , as well as unto you , and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan : and then shall ye return every man unto his possession , which I have given you . 3 : 21 And I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings : so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest . 3 : 22 Ye shall not fear them : for the LORD your God he shall fight for you . 3 : 23 And I besought the LORD at that time , saying , 3 : 24 O Lord GOD , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to thy works , and according to thy might ? 3 : 25 I pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land	l
good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire : 4 : 16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves , and make you a graven image , the similitude of any figure , the likeness of male or female , 4 : 17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air , 4 : 18 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth : 4 : 19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun , and the moon , and the stars , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be driven to worship them , and serve them , which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven . 4 : 20 But the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to	l
ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God , which he made with you , and make you a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee . 4 : 24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire , even a jealous God . 4 : 25 When thou shalt beget children , and children ' s children , and ye shall have remained long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God , to provoke him to anger : 4 : 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it ; ye shall not prolong your days upon it , but shall utterly be destroyed . 4 : 27 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the LORD shall lead you .	l

keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever ! 5 : 30 Go say to them , Get you into your tents again . 5 : 31 But as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it . 5 : 32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as	s
thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey . 6 : 4 Hear , O Israel : The LORD our God is one LORD : 6 : 5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might . 6 : 6 And these words , which I command thee this day , shall be in thine heart : 6 : 7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children , and shalt talk of them when thou	s

that thou forget not the LORD thy God , in not keeping his commandments , and his judgments , and his statutes , which I command thee this day : 8 : 12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ; 8 : 13 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ; 8 : 14 Then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the LORD thy God , which	s
the commandment of the LORD your God , and ye believed him not , nor hearkened to his voice . 9 : 24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you . 9 : 25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights , as I fell down at the first ; because the LORD had said he would destroy you . 9 : 26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD , and said , O Lord GOD , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand . 9 : 27 Remember thy servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin : 9 : 28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say , Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them , and because he hated them , he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness . 9	l

the LORD thy God ; him shalt thou serve , and to him shalt thou cleave , and swear by his name . 10 : 21 He is thy praise , and he is thy God , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen . 10 : 22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons ; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude . 11 : 1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his judgments , and his commandments , alway . 11 : 2 And know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm , 11 : 3 And his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ; 11 : 4 And	l
his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil . 11 : 15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full . 11 : 16 Take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ; 11 : 17 And then the LORD ' s wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you . 11 : 18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes . 11 : 19 And ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way	l

gods , which thou hast not known , and let us serve them ; 13 : 3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams : for the LORD your God proveth you , to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul . 13 : 4 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cleave unto him . 13 :	s
5 And that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams , shall be put to death ; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in . So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee . 13 : 6 If thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend , which is as thine own soul , entice thee secretly , saying , Let us go and serve other gods , which thou hast not known , thou , nor thy fathers ; 13 : 7 Namely , of the gods of the people which are round about you , nigh unto thee , or far off from thee , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ; 13 : 8 Thou shalt not consent unto him ,	l
God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day . 15 : 16 And it shall be , if he say unto thee , I will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he is well with thee ; 15 : 17 Then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise . 15 : 18 It shall not seem hard unto thee , when thou sendest him away free from thee ; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee , in serving thee six years : and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest . 15 : 19 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep . 15 : 20 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by	l
gates , which the LORD thy God giveth thee : 16 : 6 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt . 16 : 7 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto thy tents . 16 : 8 Six days thou shalt	s
eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God : thou shalt do no work therein . 16 : 9 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn . 16 : 10 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God , according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee : 16 : 11 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite that is within thy gates , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are among you , in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there . 16 : 12 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt : and thou shalt observe and do these	l
which the LORD thy God shall choose ; 17 : 9 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and enquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment : 17 : 10 And thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee : 17 : 11 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left . 17 : 12 And the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel . 17 : 13 And all the people shall hear , and	l

brother be not nigh unto thee , or if thou know him not , then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it to him again . 22 : 3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his raiment ; and with all lost thing of thy brother ' s , which he hath lost , and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .	s
best : thou shalt not oppress him . 23 : 17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel , nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel . 23 : 18 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God . 23 : 19 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother ; usury of money , usury of victuals , usury of any thing that is lent upon usury : 23 : 20 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it . 23 : 21 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God , thou shalt not slack to pay it : for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee ; and it would be sin in thee . 23 :	l

them unto the Levite , and unto the stranger , to the fatherless , and to the widow , according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me : I have not transgressed thy commandments , neither have I forgotten them . 26 : 14 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning , neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use , nor given ought thereof for the dead : but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God , and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me . 26 : 15 Look down from thy holy habitation , from heaven , and bless thy people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey . 26 : 16 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all thy soul . 26 : 17 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God , and to walk in	l
of the LORD thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth : 28 : 2 And all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God . 28 : 3 Blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field . 28 : 4 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and	s
, and thou shalt not borrow . 28 : 13 And the LORD shall make thee the head , and not the tail ; and thou shalt be above only , and thou shalt not be beneath ; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God , which I command thee this day , to observe and to do them : 28 : 14 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them . 28 : 15 But it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee : 28 : 16 Cursed shalt thou be in the city , and cursed shalt thou be in the field . 28 : 17 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store . 28 : 18 Cursed shall be the fruit of	l
and no man shall save thee . 28 : 30 Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof . 28 : 31 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them . 28 : 32 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long ; and there shall be no might in thine hand . 28 : 33 The fruit of thy land , and all thy labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway : 28 : 34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which	l
by the way whereof I spake unto thee , Thou shalt see it no more again : and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen , and no man shall buy you . 29 : 1 These are the words of the covenant , which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb . 29 : 2 And Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ; 29 : 3 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen , the signs , and those great miracles : 29 : 4 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , unto this day . 29 : 5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes are not waxen old upon you , and thy shoe is	l
not waxen old upon thy foot . 29 : 6 Ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink : that ye might know that I am the LORD your God . 29 : 7 And when ye came unto this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us unto battle , and we smote them : 29 : 8 And we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the	s
if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul . 30 : 11 For this commandment which I command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee , neither is it far off . 30 : 12 It is not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ? 30 : 13 Neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ? 30 : 14 But the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it . 30 : 15 See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ; 30 : 16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God , to walk in his ways , and to keep his commandments	l
possess it . 30 : 19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live : 30 : 20 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God , and that thou mayest obey his voice , and that thou mayest cleave unto him : for he is thy life , and the length of thy days : that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give them . 31 : 1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel . 31 : 2 And he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan . 31 : 3 The LORD thy God , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nations from before thee ,	l
: 11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest , fluttereth over her young , spreadeth abroad her wings , taketh them , beareth them on her wings : 32 : 12 So the LORD alone did lead him , and there was no strange god with him . 32 : 13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ; 32 : 14 Butter of kine	s
they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end ! 32 : 30 How should one chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , except their Rock had sold them , and the LORD had shut them up ? 32 : 31 For their rock is not as our Rock , even our enemies themselves being judges . 32 : 32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom , and of the fields of Gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter	s
saying , 32 : 49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession : 32 : 50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy people ; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people : 32 : 51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at	s
unto Moses , whom the LORD knew face to face , 34 : 11 In all the signs and the wonders , which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land , 34 : 12 And in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel . The Book of Joshua 1 : 1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass , that the	s
LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun , Moses ' minister , saying , 1 : 2 Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel . 1 : 3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses . 1 : 4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast . 1 : 5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor forsake thee . 1 : 6 Be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which I sware	l
2 : 6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof . 2 : 7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate . 2 : 8 And before they were laid down , she came up unto them upon the roof ; 2 : 9 And she said unto the men , I know that the LORD hath given you the land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you . 2 : 10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you , when ye came out of Egypt ; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites , that were on the other side Jordan , Sihon and Og , whom ye utterly destroyed . 2 : 11 And as soon as we had heard these	l
things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath . 2 : 12 Now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the LORD , since I have shewed you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father ' s house , and give me a true token : 2 : 13 And that ye will save alive my father , and my mother ,	s
quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear . 2 : 21 And she said , According unto your words , so be it . And she sent them away , and they departed : and she bound the scarlet line in the window . 2 : 22 And they went , and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days , until the pursuers were returned : and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not . 2 : 23 So the two men returned , and descended from the mountain , and passed over , and came to Joshua the son of Nun , and told him all things that befell them : 2 : 24 And they said unto Joshua , Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land ; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us . 3 : 1 And Joshua rose early in the morning ; and they removed from Shittim , and came to Jordan , he and all the children of Israel , and lodged there before they passed over . 3 :	l
twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day . 4 : 10 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan , until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua : and the people hasted and passed over . 4 : 11 And it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the ark of the LORD passed over , and the priests , in the presence of the people . 4 : 12 And the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spake unto them : 4 : 13 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle , to the plains of Jericho . 4 : 14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared	l
that he would not shew them the land , which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us , a land that floweth with milk and honey . 5 : 7 And their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Joshua circumcised : for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them by the way . 5 : 8 And it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole . 5 :	s
the LORD , and blew with the trumpets : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them . 6 : 9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets , and the rereward came after the ark , the priests going on , and blowing with the trumpets . 6 : 10 And Joshua had commanded the people , saying , Ye shall not shout , nor make any noise with your voice , neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth , until the day I bid you shout ; then shall ye shout . 6 : 11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp . 6 : 12 And Joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the ark of the LORD . 6 : 13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually , and blew with the trumpets : and the armed men went before them ; but the rereward came after	l
the ark of the LORD , the priests going on , and blowing with the trumpets . 6 : 14 And the second day they compassed the city once , and returned into the camp : so they did six days . 6 : 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times . 6 : 16 And it came to pass at the seventh time	s
the people to Ai . 8 : 11 And all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew nigh , and came before the city , and pitched on the north side of Ai : now there was a valley between them and Ai . 8 : 12 And he took about five thousand men , and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of the city . 8 : 13 And when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley . 8 : 14 And it came to pass , when the king of Ai saw it , that they hasted and rose up early , and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle , he and all his people , at a time appointed , before the plain ; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the	l
LORD said unto Joshua , Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai ; for I will give it into thine hand . And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city . 8 : 19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire . 8 : 20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them , they saw , and , behold , the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven , and they had no power to flee this way or that way : and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers . 8 : 21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and slew the men of Ai . 8 : 22 And the other issued out of the city against them ; so they	l
he did in Egypt , 9 : 10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites , that were beyond Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , which was at Ashtaroth . 9 : 11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us , saying , Take victuals with you for the journey , and go to meet them , and say unto them , We are your servants : therefore now make ye a league with us . 9 : 12 This	s
a man : for the LORD fought for Israel . 10 : 15 And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , unto the camp to Gilgal . 10 : 16 But these five kings fled , and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah . 10 : 17 And it was told Joshua , saying , The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah . 10 : 18 And Joshua said , Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave , and set men by it for to keep them : 10 : 19 And stay ye not , but pursue after your enemies , and smite the hindmost of them ; suffer them not to enter into their cities : for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand . 10 : 20 And it came to pass , when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities . 10 : 21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah	l
, and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed , them , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho . 10 : 29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , unto Libnah , and fought against Libnah : 10 : 30 And the LORD delivered it also , and the king thereof , into the hand of Israel ; and he smote it with	s
he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish . 10 : 36 And Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , unto Hebron ; and they fought against it : 10 : 37 And they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the souls that were therein ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but destroyed it utterly , and all	s
the Hivites , and the Jebusites : 12 : 9 The king of Jericho , one ; the king of Ai , which is beside Bethel , one ; 12 : 10 The king of Jerusalem , one ; the king of Hebron , one ; 12 : 11 The king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ; 12 : 12 The king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ; 12 : 13 The king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ; 12 : 14 The king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ; 12 : 15 The king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ; 12 : 16 The king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ; 12 : 17 The king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ; 12 : 18 The king of Aphek , one ; the king of Lasharon , one ; 12 : 19 The king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ; 12	l
: 20 The king of Shimronmeron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ; 12 : 21 The king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ; 12 : 22 The king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam of Carmel , one ; 12 : 23 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor , one ; the king of the nations of Gilgal , one ; 12 : 24 The king of Tirzah , one : all the kings thirty and one . 13 : 1 Now Joshua was	s
old and stricken in years ; and the LORD said unto him , Thou art old and stricken in years , and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed . 13 : 2 This is the land that yet remaineth : all the borders of the Philistines , and all Geshuri , 13 : 3 From Sihor , which is before Egypt , even unto the borders of Ekron northward , which is counted to the Canaanite : five lords of the Philistines ; the Gazathites , and the Ashdothites , the Eshkalonites , the Gittites , and the Ekronites ; also the Avites : 13 : 4 From the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites : 13 : 5 And the land of the Giblites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrising , from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath . 13 : 6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim , and all the Sidonians , them will I drive out from before the children of Israel : only	l
divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance , as I have commanded thee . 13 : 7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes , and the half tribe of Manasseh , 13 : 8 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them ; 13 : 9 From Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst	s
all the cities of the plain , and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , which were dukes of Sihon , dwelling in the country . 13 : 22 Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them . 13 : 23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan , and the border thereof . This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof . 13 : 24 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad , even unto the children of Gad according to their families . 13 : 25 And their coast was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , unto Aroer that is before Rabbah ; 13 : 26 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim unto the	l
tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families . 13 : 30 And their coast was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities : 13 : 31 And half Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh , even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families . 13 : 32 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab , on the other side Jordan , by Jericho , eastward . 13 : 33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance : the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance , as he said unto them . 14 : 1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of	l
Israel , distributed for inheritance to them . 14 : 2 By lot was their inheritance , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half tribe . 14 : 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan : but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them . 14 : 4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim : therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land , save	s
the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward : 15 : 3 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and fetched a compass to Karkaa : 15 : 4 From thence it passed toward Azmon , and went out unto the river of Egypt ; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast . 15 :	s
: 52 Arab , and Dumah , and Eshean , 15 : 53 And Janum , and Bethtappuah , and Aphekah , 15 : 54 And Humtah , and Kirjatharba , which is Hebron , and Zior ; nine cities with their villages : 15 : 55 Maon , Carmel , and Ziph , and Juttah , 15 : 56 And Jezreel , and Jokdeam , and Zanoah , 15 : 57 Cain , Gibeah , and Timnah ; ten cities with their villages : 15 : 58 Halhul , Bethzur , and Gedor , 15 : 59 And Maarath	s
and to Naarath , and came to Jericho , and went out at Jordan . 16 : 8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah ; and the goings out thereof were at the sea . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families . 16 : 9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages . 16 : 10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer : but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day , and serve under tribute . 17 : 1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh ; for he was the firstborn of Joseph ; to wit , for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan . 17 : 2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families ; for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek	l
and Ophrah , 18 : 24 And Chepharhaammonai , and Ophni , and Gaba ; twelve cities with their villages : 18 : 25 Gibeon , and Ramah , and Beeroth , 18 : 26 And Mizpeh , and Chephirah , and Mozah , 18 : 27 And Rekem , and Irpeel , and Taralah , 18 : 28 And Zelah , Eleph , and Jebusi , which is Jerusalem , Gibeath , and Kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages . This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families . 19 : 1 And the second lot came forth to Simeon , even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families : and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah . 19 : 2 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba , and Sheba , and Moladah , 19 : 3 And Hazarshual , and Balah , and Azem , 19 : 4 And Eltolad , and Bethul , and Hormah , 19 : 5 And Ziklag , and Bethmarcaboth , and Hazarsusah , 19 : 6 And Bethlebaoth , and Sharuhen ; thirteen cities and	l
sixteen cities with their villages . 19 : 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities and their villages . 19 : 24 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families . 19 : 25 And their border was Helkath , and Hali , and Beten , and Achshaph , 19 : 26 And Alammelech , and Amad , and Misheal ; and reacheth to Carmel westward , and to Shihorlibnath ; 19 : 27 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon , and reacheth to Zebulun , and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek , and Neiel , and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand , 19 : 28 And Hebron , and Rehob , and Hammon , and Kanah , even unto great Zidon ; 19 : 29 And then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib : 19 : 30 Ummah also	l
, and Aphek , and Rehob : twenty and two cities with their villages . 19 : 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages . 19 : 32 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali , even for the children of Naphtali according to their families . 19 : 33 And their coast was from Heleph , from Allon to Zaanannim , and Adami , Nekeb , and Jabneel , unto Lakum ; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan :	s
, that he may dwell among them . 20 : 5 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him , then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand ; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly , and hated him not beforetime . 20 : 6 And he shall dwell in that city , until he stand before the congregation for judgment , and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days : then shall the slayer return , and come unto his own city , and unto his own house , unto the city from whence he fled . 20 : 7 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali , and Shechem in mount Ephraim , and Kirjatharba , which is Hebron , in the mountain of Judah . 20 : 8 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward , they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben , and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh . 20 : 9 These were the cities appointed for	l
tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name . 21 : 10 Which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi , had : for theirs was the first lot . 21 : 11 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak , which city is Hebron , in the hill country of Judah , with the suburbs thereof round about it . 21 : 12 But the fields of the city , and the villages thereof , gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession . 21 : 13 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Libnah with her suburbs , 21 : 14 And Jattir with her suburbs , and Eshtemoa with her suburbs , 21 : 15 And Holon with her suburbs , and Debir with her suburbs , 21 : 16 And Ain with her suburbs , and Juttah with her suburbs , and Bethshemesh with her suburbs ; nine cities	l
ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD . 22 : 32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , unto the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again . 22 : 33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and did not intend to go up against them in battle , to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt . 22 : 34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed : for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God . 23 : 1 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age . 23 : 2 And Joshua called for all Israel , and for their elders , and for	l
more drive out any of these nations from before you ; but they shall be snares and traps unto you , and scourges in your sides , and thorns in your eyes , until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you . 23 : 14 And , behold , this day I am going the way of all the earth : and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls , that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you ; all are come to pass unto you , and not one thing hath failed thereof . 23 : 15 Therefore it shall come to pass , that as all good things are come upon you , which the LORD your God promised you ; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things , until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you . 23 : 16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God , which he commanded you , and have gone and	l
Israel , Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time , even Terah , the father of Abraham , and the father of Nachor : and they served other gods . 24 : 3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac . 24 : 4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave unto Esau mount Seir , to possess it ; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt . 24 : 5 I sent Moses also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them : and afterward I brought you out . 24 : 6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and ye came unto the sea ; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea . 24 : 7 And when they cried unto the LORD , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them ,	l
made a covenant with the people that day , and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem . 24 : 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the LORD . 24 : 27 And Joshua said unto all the people , Behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God . 24 : 28 So Joshua let the people depart , every man unto his inheritance . 24 : 29 And it came to pass after these things , that Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the LORD , died , being an hundred and ten years old . 24 : 30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah , which is in mount Ephraim , on the north side of the hill of Gaash . 24 : 31	l
And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua , and which had known all the works of the LORD , that he had done for Israel . 24 : 32 And the bones of Joseph , which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt , buried they in Shechem , in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver : and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph .	s
: 35 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became tributaries . 1 : 36 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim , from the rock , and upward . 2 : 1 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers ; and I said , I will never break my covenant with you . 2 : 2 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars : but ye have not obeyed my voice : why have ye done this ? 2 : 3 Wherefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you . 2 : 4 And it came to pass , when the angel	l
2 : 14 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies . 2 : 15 Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the LORD was against them for evil , as the LORD had said , and as the LORD had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed . 2 : 16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up	s
quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , I have a secret errand unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence . And all that stood by him went out from him . 3 : 20 And Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . And Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . And he arose out of his seat . 3 : 21 And Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly : 3 : 22 And the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out . 3 : 23 Then Ehud went forth through the porch , and shut the doors of the parlour upon him , and locked them . 3 : 24 When he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the	l
: 10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh ; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet : and Deborah went up with him . 4 : 11 Now Heber the Kenite , which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses , had severed himself from the Kenites , and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim , which is by Kedesh . 4 : 12 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor . 4 : 13 And Sisera gathered	s
together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon . 4 : 14 And Deborah said unto Barak , Up ; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand : is not the LORD gone out before thee ? So Barak went down from mount Tabor , and ten thousand men after him . 4 : 15 And the LORD discomfited Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his host , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot , and fled away on his feet . 4 : 16 But Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the host , unto Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword ; and there was not a man left . 4 : 17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace between Jabin the king	l
and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan . 5 : 1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day , saying , 5 : 2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel , when the people willingly offered themselves . 5 : 3 Hear , O ye kings ; give ear , O ye princes ; I , even I , will sing unto the LORD ; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel . 5 : 4 LORD , when	s
thou wentest out of Seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water . 5 : 5 The mountains melted from before the LORD , even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel . 5 : 6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied , and the travellers walked through byways . 5 : 7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased , they ceased in Israel , until that I Deborah arose , that I arose a mother in Israel . 5 : 8 They chose new gods ; then was war in the gates : was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel ? 5 : 9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel , that offered themselves willingly among the people . Bless ye the LORD . 5 : 10 Speak , ye that ride on white asses , ye that sit in judgment , and walk by the way . 5 : 11 They that are delivered from the noise	l
of archers in the places of drawing water , there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD , even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates . 5 : 12 Awake , awake , Deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , Barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of Abinoam . 5 : 13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people : the LORD made me	s
not sped ? have they not divided the prey ; to every man a damsel or two ; to Sisera a prey of divers colours , a prey of divers colours of needlework , of divers colours of needlework on both sides , meet for the necks of them that take the spoil ? 5 : 31 So let all thine enemies perish , O LORD : but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might . And the land had rest forty years . 6 : 1 And the children of	s
the LORD looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites : have not I sent thee ? 6 : 15 And he said unto him , Oh my Lord , wherewith shall I save Israel ? behold , my family is poor in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father ' s house . 6 : 16 And the LORD said unto him , Surely I will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man .	s
and called it Jehovahshalom : unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites . 6 : 25 And it came to pass the same night , that the LORD said unto him , Take thy father ' s young bullock , even the second bullock of seven years old , and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath , and cut down the grove that is by it : 6 : 26 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down . 6 : 27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as the LORD had said unto him : and so it was , because he feared his father ' s household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night . 6 : 28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the	l
meet them . 6 : 36 And Gideon said unto God , If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said , 6 : 37 Behold , I will put a fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said . 6 : 38 And it was so : for he rose up early on the morrow , and thrust the	s
, Mine own hand hath saved me . 7 : 3 Now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount Gilead . And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand . 7 : 4 And the LORD said unto Gideon , The people are yet too many ; bring them down unto the water , and I will try them for thee there : and it shall be , that of whom	s
every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley . 7 : 9 And it came to pass the same night , that the LORD said unto him , Arise , get thee down unto the host ; for I have delivered it into thine hand . 7 : 10 But if thou fear to go down , go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host : 7 : 11 And thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands	s
when he had said that . 8 : 4 And Gideon came to Jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men that were with him , faint , yet pursuing them . 8 : 5 And he said unto the men of Succoth , Give , I pray you , loaves of bread unto the people that follow me ; for they be faint , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of Midian . 8 : 6 And the princes of Succoth said , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna	s
now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ? 8 : 7 And Gideon said , Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand , then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers . 8 : 8 And he went up thence to Penuel , and spake unto them likewise : and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him . 8 : 9 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel , saying , When I come again in peace , I will break down this tower . 8 : 10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword . 8 : 11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and smote the host ; for the host was secure . 8 : 12	l
the sons of Jerubbaal , which are threescore and ten persons , reign over you , or that one reign over you ? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh . 9 : 3 And his mother ' s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother . 9 : 4 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith , wherewith Abimelech hired vain	s
, king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ;) 9 : 19 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice ye in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you : 9 : 20 But if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech . 9 : 21	s
And Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and dwelt there , for fear of Abimelech his brother . 9 : 22 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel , 9 : 23 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech : 9 : 24 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come , and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother , which slew them ; and upon the men of Shechem , which aided him in the killing of his brethren . 9 : 25 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech . 9 : 26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren , and went over to Shechem : and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him . 9 : 27 And they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode	l
the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and did eat and drink , and cursed Abimelech . 9 : 28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said , Who is Abimelech , and who is Shechem , that we should serve him ? is not he the son of Jerubbaal ? and Zebul his officer ? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem : for why should we serve him ? 9 : 29 And would to God this people were under my hand ! then would I remove	s
and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun . 12 : 13 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel , a Pirathonite , judged Israel . 12 : 14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews , that rode on threescore and ten ass colts : and he judged Israel eight years . 12 : 15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the mount of the Amalekites . 13 : 1 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years . 13 : 2 And there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not . 13 : 3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman , and said unto her , Behold now , thou art barren , and bearest not : but thou shalt conceive , and bear a son . 13 : 4 Now therefore beware	l
was an angel of the LORD . 13 : 22 And Manoah said unto his wife , We shall surely die , because we have seen God . 13 : 23 But his wife said unto him , If the LORD were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor would as at this time have told us such things as these . 13 : 24 And the woman bare a son , and called his name Samson : and the child grew , and the LORD blessed him . 13 : 25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol . 14 : 1 And Samson went down to Timnath , and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines . 14 : 2 And he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for	l
you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments : 14 : 13 But if ye cannot declare it me , then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments . And they said unto him , Put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it . 14 : 14 And he said unto them , Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . And they could not in three days expound the riddle . 14 : 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day , that they said unto Samson ' s wife , Entice thy husband , that he may declare unto us the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father ' s house with fire : have ye called us to take that we have ? is it not so ? 14 : 16 And Samson ' s wife wept before him , and said , Thou dost but hate me , and lovest me not : thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people , and hast not told it me . And he said unto	l
thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam , and said to Samson , Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us ? what is this that thou hast done unto us ? And he said unto them , As they did unto me , so have I done unto them . 15 : 12 And they said unto him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines . And Samson said unto them , Swear unto me , that ye will	s
Philistines came up unto her , and said unto her , Entice him , and see wherein his great strength lieth , and by what means we may prevail against him , that we may bind him to afflict him ; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver . 16 : 6 And Delilah said to Samson , Tell me , I pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee . 16 : 7 And Samson said unto her , If they bind	s
to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he journeyed . 17 : 9 And Micah said unto him , Whence comest thou ? And he said unto him , I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah , and I go to sojourn where I may find a place . 17 : 10 And Micah said unto him , Dwell with me , and be unto me a father and a priest , and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year , and a suit of apparel , and thy victuals . So the Levite	s
18 : 3 When they were by the house of Micah , they knew the voice of the young man the Levite : and they turned in thither , and said unto him , Who brought thee hither ? and what makest thou in this place ? and what hast thou here ? 18 : 4 And he said unto them , Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me , and hath hired me , and I am his priest . 18 : 5 And they said unto him , Ask counsel , we pray thee , of God ,	s
people secure , and to a large land : for God hath given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth . 18 : 11 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men appointed with weapons of war . 18 : 12 And they went up , and pitched in Kirjathjearim , in Judah : wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day : behold , it is behind Kirjathjearim . 18	s
war . 18 : 18 And these went into Micah ' s house , and fetched the carved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image . Then said the priest unto them , What do ye ? 18 : 19 And they said unto him , Hold thy peace , lay thine hand upon thy mouth , and go with us , and be to us a father and a priest : is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man , or that thou be a priest	s
him , Let not thy voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows run upon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the lives of thy household . 18 : 26 And the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house . 18 : 27 And they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and	s
father ' s house : and when the father of the damsel saw him , he rejoiced to meet him . 19 : 4 And his father in law , the damsel ' s father , retained him ; and he abode with him three days : so they did eat and drink , and lodged there . 19 : 5 And it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel ' s father said unto his son in law , Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way . 19 : 6 And they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the damsel ' s father had said unto the man , Be content , I pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry . 19 : 7 And when the man rose up to depart , his father in law urged him : therefore he lodged there again . 19 : 8 And he arose early in the morning on the	l
fifth day to depart ; and the damsel ' s father said , Comfort thine heart , I pray thee . And they tarried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them . 19 : 9 And when the man rose up to depart , he , and his concubine , and his servant , his father in law , the damsel ' s father , said unto him , Behold , now the day draweth toward evening , I pray you tarry all night : behold , the day groweth to an end , lodge here ,	s
you ? 20 : 13 Now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Belial , which are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel . 20 : 14 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel . 20 : 15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of	s
. 20 : 45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon : and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men ; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom , and slew two thousand men of them . 20 : 46 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword ; all these were men of valour . 20 : 47 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon , and abode in the rock Rimmon	s
all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD ? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh , saying , He shall surely be put to death . 21 : 6 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day . 21 : 7 How shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give	s
the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon , and to call peaceably unto them . 21 : 14 And Benjamin came again at that time ; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead : and yet so they sufficed them not . 21 : 15 And the people repented them for Benjamin , because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel . 21 : 16 Then the elders of the congregation said , How shall we do for wives for them that remain ,	s
have an husband . If I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ; 1 : 13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown ? would ye stay for them from having husbands ? nay , my daughters ; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me . 1 : 14 And they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother in law ; but Ruth	s
me find favour in thy sight , my lord ; for that thou hast comforted me , and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid , though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens . 2 : 14 And Boaz said unto her , At mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar . And she sat beside the reapers : and he reached her parched corn , and she did eat , and was sufficed , and left . 2 : 15 And when she	s
well ; let him do the kinsman ' s part : but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee , then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee , as the LORD liveth : lie down until the morning . 3 : 14 And she lay at his feet until the morning : and she rose up before one could know another . And he said , Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor . 3 : 15 Also he said , Bring the vail that thou	s
, and unto all the people , Ye are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech ' s , and all that was Chilion ' s and Mahlon ' s , of the hand of Naomi . 4 : 10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of Mahlon , have I purchased to be my wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren , and from the gate of his place : ye are	s
witnesses this day . 4 : 11 And all the people that were in the gate , and the elders , said , We are witnesses . The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah , which two did build the house of Israel : and do thou worthily in Ephratah , and be famous in Bethlehem : 4 : 12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez , whom Tamar bare unto Judah , of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman . 4 : 13 So Boaz took Ruth , and she was his wife : and when he went in unto her , the LORD gave her conception , and she bare a son . 4 : 14 And the women said unto Naomi , Blessed be the LORD , which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman , that his name may be famous in Israel . 4 : 15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for thy daughter in law , which loveth	l
, and did not eat . 1 : 8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her , Hannah , why weepest thou ? and why eatest thou not ? and why is thy heart grieved ? am not I better to thee than ten sons ? 1 : 9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD . 1 : 10 And she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed unto the LORD , and wept sore . 1 : 11 And she vowed a vow , and said , O LORD of hosts , if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid , and remember me , and not forget thine handmaid , but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child , then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life , and there shall no razor come upon his head . 1 : 12 And it came to pass , as she continued praying before the LORD , that Eli marked her	l
year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice . 2 : 20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife , and said , The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD . And they went unto their own home . 2 : 21 And the LORD visited Hannah , so that she conceived , and bare three sons and two daughters . And the child Samuel grew before the LORD . 2 : 22 Now Eli was very old , and heard all	s
2 : 28 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest , to offer upon mine altar , to burn incense , to wear an ephod before me ? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel ? 2 : 29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering , which I have commanded in my habitation ; and honourest thy sons above me , to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of	s
unto thee , that shall come upon thy two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of them . 2 : 35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever . 2 : 36 And it shall come to pass , that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for	s
, Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men . 4 : 3 And when the people were come into the camp , the elders of Israel said , Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines ? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us , that , when it cometh among us , it may save us out of the hand of our enemies . 4 : 4 So the people sent to Shiloh ,	s
And his daughter in law , Phinehas ' wife , was with child , near to be delivered : and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken , and that her father in law and her husband were dead , she bowed herself and travailed ; for her pains came upon her . 4 : 20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her , Fear not ; for thou hast born a son . But she answered not , neither did she regard it . 4 : 21 And she named the child Ichabod , saying , The glory is departed from Israel : because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father in law and her husband . 4 : 22 And she said , The glory is departed from Israel : for the ark of God is taken . 5 : 1 And the Philistines took the ark of God , and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod . 5 : 2 When the Philistines took the ark of God , they brought it into the house of Dagon ,	l
the LORD . 7 : 6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh , and drew water , and poured it out before the LORD , and fasted on that day , and said there , We have sinned against the LORD . And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh . 7 : 7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . And when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines . 7 : 8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel , Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . 7 : 9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb , and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD : and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel ; and the LORD heard him . 7 : 10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel : but the LORD thundered with a great	l
And he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants . 8 : 16 And he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work . 8 : 17 He will take the tenth of your sheep : and ye shall be his servants . 8 : 18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the LORD will not hear you in that day . 8 : 19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel ; and they said , Nay ; but we will have a king over us ; 8 : 20 That we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles . 8 : 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD . 8 : 22 And the LORD	l
part of a shekel of silver : that will I give to the man of God , to tell us our way . 9 : 9 ( Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to enquire of God , thus he spake , Come , and let us go to the seer : for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer .) 9 : 10 Then said Saul to his servant , Well said ; come , let us go . So they went unto the city where the man of God was . 9 : 11 And as they went up the hill to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said unto them , Is the seer here ? 9 : 12 And they answered them , and said , He is ; behold , he is before you : make haste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place : 9 : 13 As soon as ye be come into the city , ye shall straightway find	l
him , before he go up to the high place to eat : for the people will not eat until he come , because he doth bless the sacrifice ; and afterwards they eat that be bidden . Now therefore get you up ; for about this time ye shall find him . 9 : 14 And they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place . 9 : 15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in	s
servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons . 9 : 23 And Samuel said unto the cook , Bring the portion which I gave thee , of which I said unto thee , Set it by thee . 9 : 24 And the cook took up the shoulder , and that which was upon it , and set it before Saul . And Samuel said , Behold that which is left ! set it before thee , and eat : for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said , I have invited the people . So Saul did eat with Samuel that day . 9 : 25 And when they were come down from the high place into the city , Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house . 9 : 26 And they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away .	l
thou art come thither to the city , that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery , and a tabret , and a pipe , and a harp , before them ; and they shall prophesy : 10 : 6 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be turned into another man . 10 : 7 And let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for	s
God is with thee . 10 : 8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal ; and , behold , I will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : seven days shalt thou tarry , till I come to thee , and shew thee what thou shalt do . 10 : 9 And it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day . 10 : 10 And when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them . 10 : 11 And it came to pass , when all that knew him beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ? 10 : 12 And one of the same place answered and said ,	l
But who is their father ? Therefore it became a proverb , Is Saul also among the prophets ? 10 : 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place . 10 : 14 And Saul ' s uncle said unto him and to his servant , Whither went ye ? And he said , To seek the asses : and when we saw that they were no where , we came to Samuel . 10 : 15 And Saul ' s uncle said , Tell me , I pray thee ,	s
of Jabeshgilead , To morrow , by that time the sun be hot , ye shall have help . And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh ; and they were glad . 11 : 10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said , To morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you . 11 : 11 And it was so on the morrow , that Saul put the people in three companies ; and they came into the midst of the host in the	s
Jonathan , and Ishui , and Melchishua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal : 14 : 50 And the name of Saul ' s wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul ' s uncle . 14 : 51 And Kish was the father of Saul ; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel . 14 : 52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any strong man , or any valiant man , he took him unto him . 15 : 1 Samuel also said unto Saul , The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people , over Israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD . 15 : 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I remember that which Amalek did to Israel , how he laid wait for him in the	l
way , when he came up from Egypt . 15 : 3 Now go and smite Amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass . 15 : 4 And Saul gathered the people together , and numbered them in Telaim , two hundred thousand footmen , and ten thousand men of Judah . 15 : 5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek , and laid wait in the valley . 15 : 6	s
Gilgal . 15 : 22 And Samuel said , Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices , as in obeying the voice of the LORD ? Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams . 15 : 23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry . Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD , he hath also rejected thee from being king . 15 : 24 And Saul said unto Samuel , I have sinned : for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD , and thy words : because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice . 15 : 25 Now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD . 15 : 26 And Samuel said unto Saul , I will not return with thee : for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD , and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel . 15 : 27 And as Samuel turned about to go	l
36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear : and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God . 17 : 37 David said moreover , The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . And Saul said unto David , Go , and the LORD be with thee . 17 : 38 And Saul armed David with his armour ,	s
displeased him ; and he said , They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ? 18 : 9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward . 18 : 10 And it came to pass on the morrow , that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul , and he prophesied in the midst of the house : and David played with his hand , as at other times : and there was a javelin in Saul ' s	s
an hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the king ' s enemies . But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines . 18 : 26 And when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king ' s son in law : and the days were not expired . 18 : 27 Wherefore David arose and went , he and his men , and slew of the Philistines two hundred men ; and David brought their foreskins , and they gave them in full tale	s
why should my father hide this thing from me ? it is not so . 20 : 3 And David sware moreover , and said , Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes ; and he saith , Let not Jonathan know this , lest he be grieved : but truly as the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , there is but a step between me and death . 20 : 4 Then said Jonathan unto David , Whatsoever thy soul desireth , I will even do it for thee . 20	s
and , behold , if there be good toward David , and I then send not unto thee , and shew it thee ; 20 : 13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan : but if it please my father to do thee evil , then I will shew it thee , and send thee away , that thou mayest go in peace : and the LORD be with thee , as he hath been with my father . 20 : 14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD , that I die not : 20 : 15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth . 20 : 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David , saying , Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David ' s enemies . 20 : 17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again , because he loved him : for he loved him as he	l
33 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him : whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David . 20 : 34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame . 20 : 35 And it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him . 20	s
21 : 2 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest , The king hath commanded me a business , and hath said unto me , Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee , and what I have commanded thee : and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place . 21 : 3 Now therefore what is under thine hand ? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand , or what there is present . 21 : 4 And the priest answered David , and said , There is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hallowed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women . 21 : 5 And David answered the priest , and said unto him , Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days , since I came out , and the vessels of the young men are holy , and the bread is in a manner common , yea , though it were sanctified this day in the vessel . 21 : 6 So the priest gave him hallowed bread :	l
for there was no bread there but the shewbread , that was taken from before the LORD , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away . 21 : 7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the LORD ; and his name was Doeg , an Edomite , the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul . 21 : 8 And David said unto Ahimelech , And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword ? for I have neither brought my sword	s
the sword , both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen , and asses , and sheep , with the edge of the sword . 22 : 20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped , and fled after David . 22 : 21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD ' s priests . 22 : 22 And David said unto Abiathar , I knew it that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul : I	s
told him all those sayings . 25 : 13 And David said unto his men , Gird ye on every man his sword . And they girded on every man his sword ; and David also girded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred abode by the stuff . 25 : 14 But one of the young men told Abigail , Nabal ' s wife , saying , Behold , David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master ; and he railed on them . 25 : 15 But the men were very good unto us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were conversant with them , when we were in the fields : 25 : 16 They were a wall unto us both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep . 25 : 17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of Belial	l
thy voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me . 28 : 22 Now therefore , I pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on thy way . 28 : 23 But he refused , and said , I will not eat . But his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and	s
it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had invaded the south , and Ziklag , and smitten Ziklag , and burned it with fire ; 30 : 2 And had taken the women captives , that were therein : they slew not any , either great or small , but carried them away , and went on their way . 30 : 3 So David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives . 30 : 4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep . 30 : 5 And David ' s two wives were taken captives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite . 30 : 6 And David was greatly distressed ; for the people spake of stoning him , because the soul of all the people was grieved , every man for his sons	l
behold , they were spread abroad upon all the earth , eating and drinking , and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines , and out of the land of Judah . 30 : 17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which rode upon camels , and fled . 30 : 18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away : and David rescued his two wives . 30 : 19 And there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil , nor any thing that they had taken to them : David recovered all . 30 : 20 And David took all the flocks and the herds , which they drave before those other cattle , and said , This is David ' s spoil . 30 : 21 And David came to the two hundred men , which were so faint that they could not follow David , whom	l
to haunt . 31 : 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa . 31 : 2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Melchishua , Saul ' s sons . 31 : 3 And the battle went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded of the archers . 31 : 4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through , and abuse me . But his armourbearer would not ; for he was sore afraid . Therefore Saul took a sword , and fell upon it . 31 : 5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise upon his sword , and died with him . 31 : 6 So Saul died , and his three sons , and his armourbearer , and all his men , that same day together . 31 : 7	l
And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley , and they that were on the other side Jordan , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them . 31 : 8 And it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa . 31 : 9 And they cut	s
, tell me . And he answered , That the people are fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . 1 : 5 And David said unto the young man that told him , How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead ? 1 : 6 And the young man that told him said , As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa , behold , Saul leaned upon his spear ; and , lo , the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him . 1 : 7 And when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called unto me . And I answered , Here am I . 1 : 8 And he said unto me , Who art thou ? And I answered him , I am an Amalekite . 1 : 9 He said unto me again , Stand , I pray thee , upon me , and slay me : for anguish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me . 1 : 10 So I stood	l
: 3 And his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ; 3 : 4 And the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ; 3 : 5 And the sixth , Ithream , by Eglah David ' s wife . These were born to David in Hebron . 3 : 6 And it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Saul and	s
, when thou comest to see my face . 3 : 14 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul ' s son , saying , Deliver me my wife Michal , which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines . 3 : 15 And Ishbosheth sent , and took her from her husband , even from Phaltiel the son of Laish . 3 : 16 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim . Then said Abner unto him , Go , return . And he returned . 3 : 17 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel , saying , Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you : 3 : 18 Now then do it : for the LORD hath spoken of David , saying , By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies . 3 : 19 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all	l
son , had a son that was lame of his feet . He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel , and his nurse took him up , and fled : and it came to pass , as she made haste to flee , that he fell , and became lame . And his name was Mephibosheth . 4 : 5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , who lay on	s
cherubims . 6 : 3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart . 6 : 4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah , accompanying the ark of God : and Ahio went before the ark . 6 : 5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps , and on psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cymbals . 6 : 6 And when they came to Nachon ' s threshingfloor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it . 6 : 7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah ; and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of God . 6 : 8 And David was displeased , because	l
David . 7 : 18 Then went king David in , and sat before the LORD , and he said , Who am I , O Lord GOD ? and what is my house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ? 7 : 19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight , O Lord GOD ; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant ' s house for a great while to come . And is this the manner of man , O Lord GOD ? 7 : 20 And what can David say more unto	s
thy servant , and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as thou hast said . 7 : 26 And let thy name be magnified for ever , saying , The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel : and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee . 7 : 27 For thou , O LORD of hosts , God of Israel , hast revealed to thy servant , saying , I will build thee an house : therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto	s
commanded his servant , so shall thy servant do . As for Mephibosheth , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king ' s sons . 9 : 12 And Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Micha . And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth . 9 : 13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem : for he did eat continually at the king ' s table ; and was lame on both his feet . 10 : 1 And it came to pass	s
after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his stead . 10 : 2 Then said David , I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash , as his father shewed kindness unto me . And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father . And David ' s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon . 10 : 3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord , Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father , that he hath sent comforters unto thee ? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee , to search the city , and to spy it out , and to overthrow it ? 10 : 4 Wherefore Hanun took David ' s servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away . 10 : 5 When they told it unto David , he sent to meet them , because the men were greatly	l
: and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them . 10 : 17 And when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to Helam . And the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him . 10 : 18 And the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians , and forty thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captain of their host , who died there . 10 : 19 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more . 11 : 1 And it came to pass , after the year was expired , at the time when kings go forth to battle , that David sent Joab , and his servants with him , and all Israel ; and they destroyed the children of Ammon , and besieged Rabbah . But David	l
against the city , and overthrow it : and encourage thou him . 11 : 26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband . 11 : 27 And when the mourning was past , David sent and fetched her to his house , and she became his wife , and bare him a son . But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD . 12 : 1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David . And he came unto him , and said unto him ,	s
I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things . 12 : 9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD , to do evil in his sight ? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon . 12 : 10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house ; because thou hast despised me , and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife . 12 : 11 Thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and I will take thy wives before thine eyes , and give them unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun . 12 : 12 For thou didst it secretly : but I will do this thing before all Israel , and before the sun . 12 : 13 And David said unto Nathan , I have sinned against the LORD . And Nathan said unto David , The	l
LORD also hath put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die . 12 : 14 Howbeit , because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme , the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die . 12 : 15 And Nathan departed unto his house . And the LORD struck the child that Uriah ' s wife bare unto David , and it was very sick . 12 : 16 David therefore besought God for the child ; and David fasted , and went in , and lay	s
, and went to Rabbah , and fought against it , and took it . 12 : 30 And he took their king ' s crown from off his head , the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones : and it was set on David ' s head . And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance . 12 : 31 And he brought forth the people that were therein , and put them under saws , and under harrows of iron , and under axes of iron , and made	s
: but , being stronger than she , forced her , and lay with her . 13 : 15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her . And Amnon said unto her , Arise , be gone . 13 : 16 And she said unto him , There is no cause : this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me . But he would not hearken unto her . 13 : 17 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him , and said , Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her . 13 : 18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king ' s daughters that were virgins apparelled . Then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her . 13 : 19 And Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and	l
sons , and there is not one of them left . 13 : 31 Then the king arose , and tare his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent . 13 : 32 And Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David ' s brother , answered and said , Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king ' s sons ; for Amnon only is dead : for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar . 13 : 33 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king ' s sons are dead : for Amnon only is dead . 13 : 34 But Absalom fled . And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him . 13 : 35 And Jonadab said unto the king , Behold , the king ' s sons come	l
to Geshur , and was there three years . 13 : 39 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom : for he was comforted concerning Amnon , seeing he was dead . 14 : 1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king ' s heart was toward Absalom . 14 : 2 And Joab sent to Tekoah , and fetched thence a wise woman , and said unto her , I pray thee , feign thyself to be a mourner , and put on now mourning apparel , and anoint not thyself with oil , but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead : 14 : 3 And come to the king , and speak on this manner unto him . So Joab put the words in her mouth . 14 : 4 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obeisance , and said , Help , O king . 14 : 5 And the king said unto her , What aileth thee ? And she answered , I am indeed	l
an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . 14 : 21 And the king said unto Joab , Behold now , I have done this thing : go therefore , bring the young man Absalom again . 14 : 22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Joab said , To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant . 14 : 23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur , and brought Absalom to Jerusalem . 14 : 24 And the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . So Absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king ' s face . 14 : 25 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him	l
before the king . 15 : 19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite , Wherefore goest thou also with us ? return to thy place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also an exile . 15 : 20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing I go whither I may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee . 15 : 21 And Ittai answered the king , and said , As the LORD liveth , and as my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be . 15 : 22 And David said to Ittai , Go and pass over . And Ittai the Gittite passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones that were with him . 15 : 23 And all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself	l
asses saddled , and upon them two hundred loaves of bread , and an hundred bunches of raisins , and an hundred of summer fruits , and a bottle of wine . 16 : 2 And the king said unto Ziba , What meanest thou by these ? And Ziba said , The asses be for the king ' s household to ride on ; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat ; and the wine , that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink . 16 : 3 And the king said	s
thus have I counselled . 17 : 16 Now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness , but speedily pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people that are with him . 17 : 17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel ; for they might not be seen to come into the city : and a wench went and told them ; and they went and told king David . 17 : 18 Nevertheless a lad saw them , and	s
: 15 And ten young men that bare Joab ' s armour compassed about and smote Absalom , and slew him . 18 : 16 And Joab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing after Israel : for Joab held back the people . 18 : 17 And they took Absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent . 18 : 18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up	s
, If he be alone , there is tidings in his mouth . And he came apace , and drew near . 18 : 26 And the watchman saw another man running : and the watchman called unto the porter , and said , Behold another man running alone . And the king said , He also bringeth tidings . 18 : 27 And the watchman said , Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok . And the king said , He is a good man , and cometh with good tidings . 18 : 28 And Ahimaaz called , and said unto the king , All is well . And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king , and said , Blessed be the LORD thy God , which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king . 18 : 29 And the king said , Is the young man Absalom safe ? And Ahimaaz answered , When Joab sent the king ' s servant , and me thy servant , I saw a great tumult ,	l
ye to Amasa , Art thou not of my bone , and of my flesh ? God do so to me , and more also , if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab . 19 : 14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as the heart of one man ; so that they sent this word unto the king , Return thou , and all thy servants . 19 : 15 So the king returned , and came to Jordan . And Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan . 19 : 16 And Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite , which was of Bahurim , hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David . 19 : 17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king . 19 : 18 And there went over	l
therefore what is good in thine eyes . 19 : 28 For all of my father ' s house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table . What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ? 19 : 29 And the king said unto him , Why speakest thou any more of thy matters ? I have said , Thou and Ziba divide the land . 19 : 30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king , Yea , let him take all , forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house . 19 : 31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim , and went over Jordan with the king , to conduct him over Jordan . 19 : 32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old : and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man . 19 : 33 And the king said unto Barzillai , Come thou over with	l
3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem ; and the king took the ten women his concubines , whom he had left to keep the house , and put them in ward , and fed them , but went not in unto them . So they were shut up unto the day of their death , living in widowhood . 20 : 4 Then said the king to Amasa , Assemble me the men of Judah within three days , and be thou here present . 20 : 5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah	s
street of Bethshan , where the Philistines had hanged them , when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa : 21 : 13 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son ; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged . 21 : 14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah , in the sepulchre of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . And after that God was intreated for the land	s
strength and power : and he maketh my way perfect . 22 : 34 He maketh my feet like hinds ' feet : and setteth me upon my high places . 22 : 35 He teacheth my hands to war ; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms . 22 : 36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness hath made me great . 22 : 37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me ; so that my feet did not slip . 22 : 38 I have pursued	s
: thou hast delivered me from the violent man . 22 : 50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the heathen , and I will sing praises unto thy name . 22 : 51 He is the tower of salvation for his king : and sheweth mercy to his anointed , unto David , and to his seed for evermore . 23 : 1 Now these be the last words of David . David the son of Jesse said , and the man who was raised up on high , the anointed of the God of Jacob , and the sweet psalmist of Israel , said , 23 : 2 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me , and his word was in my tongue . 23 : 3 The God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spake to me , He that ruleth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God . 23 : 4 And he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without clouds ; as the tender grass springing out of the earth	l
went up as the LORD commanded . 24 : 20 And Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground . 24 : 21 And Araunah said , Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant ? And David said , To buy the threshingfloor of thee , to build an altar unto the LORD , that the plague may be stayed from the people . 24 : 22 And Araunah said unto David ,	s
the king , and ministered to him : but the king knew her not . 1 : 5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him . 1 : 6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom . 1 : 7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest : and they following Adonijah helped him . 1 : 8 But Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah . 1 : 9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by Enrogel , and called all his brethren the king ' s sons , and all the men of Judah the king ' s servants	l
: 19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called . 1 : 20 And thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him . 1 : 21 Otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord	s
servant Solomon , hath he not called . 1 : 27 Is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ? 1 : 28 Then king David answered and said , Call me Bathsheba . And she came into the king ' s presence , and stood before the king . 1 : 29 And the king sware , and said , As the LORD liveth , that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress	s
thence rejoicing , so that the city rang again . This is the noise that ye have heard . 1 : 46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom . 1 : 47 And moreover the king ' s servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . And the king bowed himself upon the bed . 1 : 48 And also thus said the king , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it . 1 : 49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid , and rose up , and went every man his way . 1 : 50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon , and arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar . 1 : 51 And it was told Solomon , saying , Behold , Adonijah feareth king Solomon : for , lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the	l
altar , saying , Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword . 1 : 52 And Solomon said , If he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be found in him , he shall die . 1 : 53 So king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon : and Solomon said unto him , Go to thine house	s
at thy table : for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother . 2 : 8 And , behold , thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite of Bahurim , which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim : but he came down to meet me at Jordan , and I sware to him by the LORD , saying , I will not put thee to death with the sword . 2 : 9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him ; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood . 2 : 10 So David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David . 2 : 11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem . 2 : 12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father ; and his kingdom was established greatly	l
Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife . 2 : 22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother , And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ? ask for him the kingdom also ; for he is mine elder brother ; even for him , and for Abiathar the priest , and for Joab the son of Zeruiah . 2 : 23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD , saying , God do so to me , and more also , if Adonijah have not spoken this word against	s
thou wilt walk in my ways , to keep my statutes and my commandments , as thy father David did walk , then I will lengthen thy days . 3 : 15 And Solomon awoke ; and , behold , it was a dream . And he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants . 3 : 16 Then came there two women , that were harlots , unto the king , and stood before him . 3 : 17 And the one woman said , O my lord , I and this woman dwell in one house ; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house . 3 : 18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house . 3 : 19 And this woman ' s child died in the night ;	l
the living is my son , and the dead is thy son . And this said , No ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son . Thus they spake before the king . 3 : 23 Then said the king , The one saith , This is my son that liveth , and thy son is the dead : and the other saith , Nay ; but thy son is the dead , and my son is the living . 3 : 24 And the king said , Bring me a sword . And they brought a sword before the king . 3 : 25 And the king said , Divide the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other . 3 : 26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king , for her bowels yearned upon her son , and she said , O my lord , give her the living child , and in no wise slay it . But the other said , Let it be neither mine nor thine , but divide it . 3	l
sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home : and Adoniram was over the levy . 5 : 15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens , and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains ; 5 : 16 Beside the chief of Solomon ' s officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that wrought in the work . 5 : 17 And the king commanded , and they brought great	s
6 : 5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he made chambers round about : 6 : 6 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house . 6 : 7	s
. 7 : 21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and called the name thereof Boaz . 7 : 22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work : so was the work of the pillars finished . 7 : 23 And he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was	s
graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about . 7 : 37 After this manner he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one size . 7 : 38 Then made he ten lavers of brass : one laver contained forty baths : and every laver was four cubits : and upon every one of the ten bases one laver . 7 : 39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house , and	s
king Solomon for the house of the LORD , were of bright brass . 7 : 46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan . 7 : 47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed , because they were exceeding many : neither was the weight of the brass found out . 7 : 48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was , 7 :	s
49 And the candlesticks of pure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , with the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs of gold , 7 : 50 And the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple . 7 : 51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD . And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD . 8 : 1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel , unto king Solomon in Jerusalem , that they might bring up the ark	l
and the Levites bring up . 8 : 5 And king Solomon , and all the congregation of Israel , that were assembled unto him , were with him before the ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen , that could not be told nor numbered for multitude . 8 : 6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims . 8 : 7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above . 8 : 8 And they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day . 8 : 9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone , which Moses put there at Horeb , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out	l
day : 8 : 29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which thou hast said , My name shall be there : that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place . 8 : 30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive . 8 : 31 If any man trespass against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house : 8 : 32 Then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness . 8 : 33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee , and shall turn again to thee , and confess	l
thy name , and pray , and make supplication unto thee in this house : 8 : 34 Then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers . 8 : 35 When heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou afflictest them : 8 : 36 Then hear thou in heaven	s
9 : 13 And he said , What cities are these which thou hast given me , my brother ? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day . 9 : 14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold . 9 : 15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised ; for to build the house of the LORD , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer . 9 : 16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon ' s wife . 9 : 17 And Solomon built Gezer , and Bethhoron the nether , 9 : 18 And Baalath , and Tadmor in the wilderness , in the land , 9 : 19 And all the cities of store that Solomon had , and cities for his chariots , and cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired	l
to build in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion . 9 : 20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , which were not of the children of Israel , 9 : 21 Their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy , upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day . 9 : 22 But of the children of Israel did	s
these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon . 10 : 11 And the navy also of Hiram , that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees , and precious stones . 10 : 12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD , and for the king ' s house , harps also and psalteries for singers : there came no such almug trees , nor were seen unto this day . 10 : 13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty . So she turned and went to her own country , she and her servants . 10 : 14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold , 10 : 15 Beside that he had of the merchantmen , and of the traffick of the spice merchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the governors of the country . 10 : 16 And	l
king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold : six hundred shekels of gold went to one target . 10 : 17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three pound of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon . 10 : 18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with the best gold . 10 : 19 The throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stays	s
Chemosh , the abomination of Moab , in the hill that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech , the abomination of the children of Ammon . 11 : 8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives , which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods . 11 : 9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel , which had appeared unto him twice , 11 : 10 And had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he kept not that which the LORD commanded . 11 : 11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon , Forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant . 11 : 12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father ' s sake : but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son . 11 : 13 Howbeit I will	l
that Joab the captain of the host was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country . 11 : 22 Then Pharaoh said unto him , But what hast thou lacked with me , that , behold , thou seekest to go to thine own country ? And he answered , Nothing : howbeit let me go in any wise . 11 : 23 And God stirred him up another adversary , Rezon the son of Eliadah , which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah : 11	s
out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field : 11 : 30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him , and rent it in twelve pieces : 11 : 31 And he said to Jeroboam , Take thee ten pieces : for thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , Behold , I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes	s
when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ;) 12 : 3 That they sent and called him . And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came , and spake unto Rehoboam , saying , 12 : 4 Thy father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father , and his heavy yoke which he put upon us , lighter , and we will serve thee	s
up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it lighter unto us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father ' s loins . 12 : 11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father hath chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions . 12 : 12	s
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king had appointed , saying , Come to me again the third day . 12 : 13 And the king answered the people roughly , and forsook the old men ' s counsel that they gave him ; 12 : 14 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men , saying , My father made your yoke heavy , and I will add to your yoke : my father also chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions . 12 : 15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the LORD , that he might perform his saying , which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat . 12 : 16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them , the people answered the king , saying , What portion have we in David ? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse : to your tents , O Israel : now see to thine own house , David .	l
all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again , that they sent and called him unto the congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only . 12 : 21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah , with the tribe of Benjamin , an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon . 12 : 22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God , saying , 12 : 23 Speak unto Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the remnant of the people , saying , 12 : 24 Thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel : return every man to his house ; for this thing is from me . They hearkened therefore to the word of	l
Judah , and they shall kill me , and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah . 12 : 28 Whereupon the king took counsel , and made two calves of gold , and said unto them , It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem : behold thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt . 12 : 29 And he set the one in Bethel , and the other put he in Dan . 12 : 30 And this thing became a sin : for the people went to worship before the one , even unto Dan . 12 : 31 And he made an house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of Levi . 12 : 32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month , on the fifteenth day of the month , like unto the feast that is in Judah , and he offered upon the altar . So did he in Bethel , sacrificing unto the calves that he had made : and he placed in Bethel the	l
incense . 13 : 2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD , and said , O altar , altar , thus saith the LORD ; Behold , a child shall be born unto the house of David , Josiah by name ; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee , and men ' s bones shall be burnt upon thee . 13 : 3 And he gave a sign the same day , saying , This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken ; Behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out . 13 : 4 And it came to pass , when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God , which had cried against the altar in Bethel , that he put forth his hand from the altar , saying , Lay hold on him . And his hand , which he put forth against him , dried up , so that he could not pull it in again to him . 13 : 5 The altar also	l
saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back . 13 : 24 And when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase . 13 : 25 And , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt . 13 : 26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof , he said , It is the man of God , who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD : therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion , which hath torn him , and slain him , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake unto him . 13 : 27 And he spake to his sons , saying , Saddle me the ass . And they saddled him . 13 :	l
28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way , and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase : the lion had not eaten the carcase , nor torn the ass . 13 : 29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him . 13 : 30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave ; and they mourned over him ,	s
off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel , and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam , as a man taketh away dung , till it be all gone . 14 : 11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the LORD hath spoken it . 14 : 12 Arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house : and when thy feet enter into the city , the child shall die . 14 : 13 And all Israel shall mourn for him , and bury him : for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam . 14 : 14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day : but what ? even now . 14 : 15 For the LORD shall smite Israel	l
came up against Jerusalem : 14 : 26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king ' s house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made . 14 : 27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king ' s house . 14 : 28 And it was so , when the king went into the house of the LORD , that the guard bare them , and brought them back into the guard chamber . 14 : 29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? 14 : 30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days . 14 : 31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . And his mother ' s name was	l
and thee , and between my father and thy father : behold , I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold ; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me . 15 : 20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abelbethmaachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali . 15 : 21 And it came to pass , when	s
Baasha heard thereof , that he left off building of Ramah , and dwelt in Tirzah . 15 : 22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha had builded ; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah . 15 : 23 The rest of all the acts of Asa , and all his might , and all that he did , and the cities which he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet . 15 : 24 And Asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead . 15 : 25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned over Israel two years . 15 : 26 And he did evil in the	l
sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin . 15 : 27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon . 15 : 28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him , and reigned in his stead . 15 : 29 And it came to pass	s
kings of Israel ? 16 : 28 So Omri slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria : and Ahab his son reigned in his stead . 16 : 29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years . 16 : 30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him . 16 : 31 And it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshipped him . 16 : 32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal , which he had built in Samaria . 16 : 33 And Ahab made a grove ; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the	l
behold , I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee . 17 : 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath . And when he came to the gate of the city , behold , the widow woman was there gathering of sticks : and he called to her , and said , Fetch me , I pray thee , a little water in a vessel , that I may drink . 17 : 11 And as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring me , I pray thee	s
is here . 18 : 12 And it shall come to pass , as soon as I am gone from thee , that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not ; and so when I come and tell Ahab , and he cannot find thee , he shall slay me : but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth . 18 : 13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD , how I hid an hundred men of the LORD ' s prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ? 18 : 14 And now thou sayest , Go , tell thy lord , Behold , Elijah is here : and he shall slay me . 18 : 15 And Elijah said , As the LORD of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , I will surely shew myself unto him to day . 18 : 16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab , and told him : and Ahab went to meet Elijah . 18 : 17 And it came to pass , when	l
. 18 : 20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel , and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel . 18 : 21 And Elijah came unto all the people , and said , How long halt ye between two opinions ? if the LORD be God , follow him : but if Baal , then follow him . And the people answered him not a word . 18 : 22 Then said Elijah unto the people , I , even I only , remain a prophet of the LORD ; but Baal ' s prophets are four hundred and fifty men . 18 : 23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks ; and let them choose one bullock for themselves , and cut it in pieces , and lay it on wood , and put no fire under : and I will dress the other bullock , and lay it on wood , and put no fire under : 18 : 24 And call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of the LORD : and the God that answereth by fire , let him be God	l
. And all the people answered and said , It is well spoken . 18 : 25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , Choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under . 18 : 26 And they took the bullock which was given them , and they dressed it , and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon , saying , O Baal , hear us . But there was	s
and on the wood . 18 : 34 And he said , Do it the second time . And they did it the second time . And he said , Do it the third time . And they did it the third time . 18 : 35 And the water ran round about the altar ; and he filled the trench also with water . 18 : 36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that Elijah the prophet came near , and said , LORD God of Abraham , Isaac , and of Israel , let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel , and that I am thy servant , and that I have done all these things at thy word . 18 : 37 Hear me , O LORD , hear me , that this people may know that thou art the LORD God , and that thou hast turned their heart back again . 18 : 38 Then the fire of the LORD fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust ,	l
. 19 : 3 And when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beersheba , which belongeth to Judah , and left his servant there . 19 : 4 But he himself went a day ' s journey into the wilderness , and came and sat down under a juniper tree : and he requested for himself that he might die ; and said , It is enough ; now , O LORD , take away my life ; for I am not better than my fathers . 19 : 5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree , behold , then an angel touched him , and said unto him , Arise and eat . 19 : 6 And he looked , and , behold , there was a cake baken on the coals , and a cruse of water at his head . And he did eat and drink , and laid him down again . 19 : 7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time , and touched him , and said , Arise and eat ; because the journey is	l
, every man out of his place , and put captains in their rooms : 20 : 25 And number thee an army , like the army that thou hast lost , horse for horse , and chariot for chariot : and we will fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they . And he hearkened unto their voice , and did so . 20 : 26 And it came to pass at the return of the year , that Benhadad numbered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel . 20 : 27 And the children of Israel were numbered , and were all present , and went against them : and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids ; but the Syrians filled the country . 20 : 28 And there came a man of God , and spake unto the king of Israel , and said , Thus saith the LORD , Because the Syrians have said , The LORD is God of the hills , but he is not God of the valleys , therefore will I deliver	l
all this great multitude into thine hand , and ye shall know that I am the LORD . 20 : 29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days . And so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day . 20 : 30 But the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left . And Benhadad fled , and	s
will not give thee my vineyard . 21 : 7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him , Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel ? arise , and eat bread , and let thine heart be merry : I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite . 21 : 8 So she wrote letters in Ahab ' s name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city , dwelling with Naboth . 21 : 9 And she wrote in the letters , saying , Proclaim a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people : 21 : 10 And set two men , sons of Belial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , Thou didst blaspheme God and the king . And then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die . 21 : 11 And the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written	l
Thus saith the LORD , In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood , even thine . 21 : 20 And Ahab said to Elijah , Hast thou found me , O mine enemy ? And he answered , I have found thee : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD . 21 : 21 Behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him	s
prophet of the LORD besides , that we might enquire of him ? 22 : 8 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , There is yet one man , Micaiah the son of Imlah , by whom we may enquire of the LORD : but I hate him ; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me , but evil . And Jehoshaphat said , Let not the king say so . 22 : 9 Then the king of Israel called an officer , and said , Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah . 22 : 10	s
not ; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber . 22 : 49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat , Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships . But Jehoshaphat would not . 22 : 50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead . 22 : 51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned two years	s
over Israel . 22 : 52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin : 22 : 53 For he served Baal , and worshipped him , and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel , according to all that his father had done . The First Book of the Kings Commonly Called : The Fourth Book of the Kings 1 : 1 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab . 1 : 2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria , and was sick : and he sent messengers , and said unto them , Go , enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease . 1 : 3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite , Arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say unto them , Is it not because there	l
is not a God in Israel , that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ? 1 : 4 Now therefore thus saith the LORD , Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up , but shalt surely die . And Elijah departed . 1 : 5 And when the messengers turned back unto him , he said unto them , Why are ye now turned back ? 1 : 6 And they said unto him , There came a man up to meet us , and said unto us ,	s
, there appeared a chariot of fire , and horses of fire , and parted them both asunder ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven . 2 : 12 And Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof . And he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces . 2 : 13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back ,	s
and he turned into the chamber , and lay there . 4 : 12 And he said to Gehazi his servant , Call this Shunammite . And when he had called her , she stood before him . 4 : 13 And he said unto him , Say now unto her , Behold , thou hast been careful for us with all this care ; what is to be done for thee ? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king , or to the captain of the host ? And she answered , I dwell among mine own people	s
wilt thou go to him to day ? it is neither new moon , nor sabbath . And she said , It shall be well . 4 : 24 Then she saddled an ass , and said to her servant , Drive , and go forward ; slack not thy riding for me , except I bid thee . 4 : 25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel . And it came to pass , when the man of God saw her afar off , that he said to Gehazi his servant , Behold , yonder is that Shunammite : 4 : 26 Run now , I pray thee , to meet her , and say unto her , Is it well with thee ? is it well with thy husband ? is it well with the child ? And she answered , It is well : 4 : 27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill , she caught him by the feet : but Gehazi came near to thrust her away . And the man of God said , Let her alone ; for her soul	l
the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes . 4 : 36 And he called Gehazi , and said , Call this Shunammite . So he called her . And when she was come in unto him , he said , Take up thy son . 4 : 37 Then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out . 4 :	s
38 And Elisha came again to Gilgal : and there was a dearth in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , Set on the great pot , and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets . 4 : 39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage : for they knew them not . 4 : 40 So they poured out for the men to eat . And it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out , and said , O thou man of God , there is death in the pot . And they could not eat thereof . 4 : 41 But he said , Then bring meal . And he cast it into the pot ; and he said , Pour out for the people , that they may eat . And there was no harm in the pot . 4 : 42 And there	l
unto the LORD . 5 : 18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant , that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there , and he leaneth on my hand , and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon : when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon , the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing . 5 : 19 And he said unto him , Go in peace . So he departed from him a little way . 5 : 20 But Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the	s
tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed . 5 : 25 But he went in , and stood before his master . And Elisha said unto him , Whence comest thou , Gehazi ? And he said , Thy servant went no whither . 5 : 26 And he said unto him , Went not mine heart with thee , when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee ? Is it a time to receive money , and	s
eaten and drunk , he sent them away , and they went to their master . So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel . 6 : 24 And it came to pass after this , that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host , and went up , and besieged Samaria . 6 : 25 And there was a great famine in Samaria : and , behold , they besieged it , until an ass ' s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a cab of dove ' s dung for five pieces of silver . 6 : 26 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall , there cried a woman unto him , saying , Help , my lord , O king . 6 : 27 And he said , If the LORD do not help thee , whence shall I help thee ? out of the barnfloor , or out of the winepress ? 6 : 28 And the king said unto her , What aileth thee ? And she answered , This woman said unto me ,	l
also , and went and hid it . 7 : 9 Then they said one to another , We do not well : this day is a day of good tidings , and we hold our peace : if we tarry till the morning light , some mischief will come upon us : now therefore come , that we may go and tell the king ' s household . 7 : 10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city : and they told them , saying , We came to the camp of the Syrians , and , behold , there was no man there , neither voice of man , but horses tied , and asses tied , and the tents as they were . 7 : 11 And he called the porters ; and they told it to the king ' s house within . 7 : 12 And the king arose in the night , and said unto his servants , I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us . They know that we be hungry ; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in	l
, and he died . 8 : 1 Then spake Elisha unto the woman , whose son he had restored to life , saying , Arise , and go thou and thine household , and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn : for the LORD hath called for a famine ; and it shall also come upon the land seven years . 8 : 2 And the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years . 8 : 3 And it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines : and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land . 8 : 4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha hath done . 8 : 5 And it came to pass , as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to	l
22 And it came to pass , when Joram saw Jehu , that he said , Is it peace , Jehu ? And he answered , What peace , so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many ? 9 : 23 And Joram turned his hands , and fled , and said to Ahaziah , There is treachery , O Ahaziah . 9 : 24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot . 9 : 25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain , Take up , and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite : for remember how that , when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father , the LORD laid this burden upon him ; 9 : 26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth , and the blood of his sons , saith the LORD ; and I will requite thee in this plat , saith the LORD . Now therefore take and cast	l
with his fathers in the city of David . 9 : 29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah . 9 : 30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window . 9 : 31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate , she said , Had Zimri peace , who slew his master ? 9 : 32 And he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs . 9 : 33 And he said , Throw her down . So they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot . 9 : 34 And when he was come in , he did eat and drink , and said , Go , see now this cursed woman , and bury her : for she is a king '	l
the field in the portion of Jezreel ; so that they shall not say , This is Jezebel . 10 : 1 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . And Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , unto the rulers of Jezreel , to the elders , and to them that brought up Ahab ' s children , saying , 10 : 2 Now as soon as this letter cometh to you , seeing your master ' s sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fenced city also , and armour ; 10 : 3 Look even out the best and meetest of your master ' s sons , and set him on his father ' s throne , and fight for your master ' s house . 10 : 4 But they were exceedingly afraid , and said , Behold , two kings stood not before him : how then shall we stand ? 10 : 5 And he that was over the house , and he that was over the city , the elders also , and the bringers up of the children , sent to Jehu	l
to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen . 10 : 14 And he said , Take them alive . And they took them alive , and slew them at the pit of the shearing house , even two and forty men ; neither left he any of them . 10 : 15 And when he was departed thence , he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him : and he saluted him , and said to him , Is thine heart right , as my heart is with thy heart ? And Jehonadab answered , It is . If it be , give me thine hand . And he gave him his hand ; and he took him up to him into the chariot . 10 : 16 And he said , Come with me , and see my zeal for the LORD . So they made him ride in his chariot . 10 : 17 And when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the LORD , which he spake	l
of Baal , and burned them . 10 : 27 And they brake down the image of Baal , and brake down the house of Baal , and made it a draught house unto this day . 10 : 28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel . 10 : 29 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan . 10 : 30 And the LORD said unto Jehu , Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes , and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart , thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . 10 : 31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , which made Israel to sin . 10 : 32 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel	l
11 : 7 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king . 11 : 8 And ye shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that cometh within the ranges , let him be slain : and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in . 11 : 9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that should go out on the sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest . 11 : 10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David ' s spears and shields , that were in the temple of the LORD . 11 : 11 And the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the	l
temple , along by the altar and the temple . 11 : 12 And he brought forth the king ' s son , and put the crown upon him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and anointed him ; and they clapped their hands , and said , God save the king . 11 : 13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the temple of the LORD . 11 : 14 And when she looked , behold , the	s
; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD . 11 : 19 And he took the rulers over hundreds , and the captains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king ' s house . And he sat on the throne of	s
, 12 : 5 Let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found . 12 : 6 But it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house . 12 : 7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no	s
the LORD : 12 : 14 But they gave that to the workmen , and repaired therewith the house of the LORD . 12 : 15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men , into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen : for they dealt faithfully . 12 : 16 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD : it was the priests '. 12 : 17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up , and fought against Gath , and took it : and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem . 12 : 18 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat , and Jehoram , and Ahaziah , his fathers , kings of Judah , had dedicated , and his own hallowed things , and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD , and in the king ' s house , and sent it to Hazael king of Syria : and he went away from Jerusalem . 12 : 19 And the rest of the acts of Joash , and all	l
in the house of the LORD , and in the treasures of the king ' s house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria . 14 : 15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ? 14 : 16 And Jehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead . 14 : 17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years . 14 : 18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? 14 : 19 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem : and he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and slew him there . 14 : 20 And they brought him on horses : and he	l
six months . 15 : 9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin . 15 : 10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him , and smote him before the people , and slew him , and reigned in his stead . 15 : 11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the	s
the kingdom in his hand . 15 : 20 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of Assyria . So the king of Assyria turned back , and stayed not there in the land . 15 : 21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ? 15 : 22 And Menahem slept with his fathers ; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead . 15 : 23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned two years . 15 : 24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin . 15 : 25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah , a captain of his , conspired against him , and smote him in	l
Samaria , in the palace of the king ' s house , with Argob and Arieh , and with him fifty men of the Gileadites : and he killed him , and reigned in his room . 15 : 26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel . 15 : 27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and	s
: 33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . And his mother ' s name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok . 15 : 34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD : he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done . 15 : 35 Howbeit the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places . He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD	s
out from before the children of Israel . 16 : 4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree . 16 : 5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him . 16 : 6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drave the Jews from Elath : and the Syrians came to Elath , and dwelt there unto	s
altar , which was before the LORD , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the LORD , and put it on the north side of the altar . 16 : 15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest , saying , Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering , and the evening meat offering , and the king ' s burnt sacrifice , and his meat offering , with the burnt offering of all the people of the land , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings ; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering , and all the blood of the sacrifice : and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by . 16 : 16 Thus did Urijah the priest , according to all that king Ahaz commanded . 16 : 17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the laver from off them ; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it , and put it upon the pavement of stones . 16 : 18 And	l
those things that were not right against the LORD their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city . 17 : 10 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill , and under every green tree : 17 : 11 And there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger : 17 : 12 For they served idols , whereof the LORD had said unto them , Ye shall not do this thing . 17 : 13 Yet the LORD testified against Israel , and against Judah , by all the prophets , and by all the seers , saying , Turn ye from your evil ways , and keep my commandments and my statutes , according to all the law which I commanded your fathers , and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets . 17 : 14 Notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of	l
So these nations feared the LORD , and served their graven images , both their children , and their children ' s children : as did their fathers , so do they unto this day . 18 : 1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign . 18 : 2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . His mother ' s name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah . 18 : 3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that David his father did . 18 : 4 He removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the groves , and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it : and he called it Nehushtan . 18 : 5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel ;	l
18 : 14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish , saying , I have offended ; return from me : that which thou puttest on me will I bear . And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold . 18 : 15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD , and in the treasures of the king ' s house . 18 : 16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off	s
able to deliver you out of his hand : 18 : 30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria . 18 : 31 Hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern : 18 : 32 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of oil olive and of honey , that ye may live , and not die : and hearken not unto Hezekiah , when he persuadeth you , saying , The LORD will deliver us . 18 : 33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king	l
Answer him not . 18 : 37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rabshakeh . 19 : 1 And it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the LORD . 19 : 2 And he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz . 19 : 3 And they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy ; for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth . 19 : 4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach	l
21 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him ; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee . 19 : 22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel . 19 : 23 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD , and hast said , With the multitude of my chariots I am come	s
up to the height of the mountains , to the sides of Lebanon , and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof , and the choice fir trees thereof : and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders , and into the forest of his Carmel . 19 : 24 I have digged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places . 19 : 25 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps . 19 : 26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the house tops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up . 19 : 27 But I know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy rage against me .	l
19 : 28 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears , therefore I will put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest . 19 : 29 And this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards ,	s
fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David ' s sake . 20 : 7 And Isaiah said , Take a lump of figs . And they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered . 20 : 8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah , What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of the	s
LORD the third day ? 20 : 9 And Isaiah said , This sign shalt thou have of the LORD , that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ? 20 : 10 And Hezekiah answered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees . 20 : 11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD : and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward , by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz . 20 : 12 At that time Berodachbaladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah : for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick . 20 : 13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them , and shewed them all the house of his precious things , the silver , and the gold , and the spices , and the precious ointment , and all the house of his armour , and all that was found in his treasures :	l
destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made a grove , as did Ahab king of Israel ; and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them . 21 : 4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD , of which the LORD said , In Jerusalem will I put my name . 21 : 5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD . 21 : 6 And he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger . 21 : 7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house , of which the LORD said to David , and to Solomon his son , In this house , and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel , will I put my name for ever : 21 : 8 Neither will I make	l
the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers ; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them , and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them . 21 : 9 But they hearkened not : and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel . 21 : 10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets , saying , 21 : 11 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath	s
women wove hangings for the grove . 23 : 8 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah , and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense , from Geba to Beersheba , and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city , which were on a man ' s left hand at the gate of the city . 23 : 9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem , but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren . 23 : 10 And he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech . 23 : 11 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun , at the entering in of the house of the LORD , by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain , which was in the suburbs , and burned	l
the chariots of the sun with fire . 23 : 12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD , did the king beat down , and brake them down from thence , and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron . 23 : 13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem , which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption ,	s
, did Josiah put away , that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD . 23 : 25 And like unto him was there no king before him , that turned to the LORD with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him . 23 : 26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great	s
of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king ' s house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD , as the LORD had said . 24 : 14 And he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of valour , even ten thousand captives , and all the craftsmen and smiths : none remained , save the poorest sort of the people of the land . 24 : 15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , and the king ' s mother , and the king ' s wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon . 24 : 16 And all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and smiths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon . 24 : 17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father ' s brother king in his	l
life . 25 : 30 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .

thereof every morning pertained to them . 9 : 28 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels , that they should bring them in and out by tale . 9 : 29 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanctuary , and the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices . 9 : 30 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices . 9 : 31 And Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the set office over the things that were made in the pans . 9 : 32 And other of their brethren , of the sons of the Kohathites , were over the shewbread , to prepare it every sabbath . 9 : 33 And these are the singers , chief of the fathers of the Levites , who remaining in the chambers were free : for they were employed in that work day and night . 9 : 34 These chief fathers of the Levites	l
begat Kish ; and Kish begat Saul ; and Saul begat Jonathan , and Malchishua , and Abinadab , and Eshbaal . 9 : 40 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal : and Meribbaal begat Micah . 9 : 41 And the sons of Micah were , Pithon , and Melech , and Tahrea , and Ahaz . 9 : 42 And Ahaz begat Jarah ; and Jarah begat Alemeth , and Azmaveth , and Zimri ; and Zimri begat Moza ; 9 : 43 And Moza begat Binea ; and Rephaiah his son , Eleasah his son , Azel his son . 9 : 44 And Azel had six sons , whose names are these , Azrikam , Bocheru , and Ishmael , and Sheariah , and Obadiah , and Hanan : these were the sons of Azel . 10 : 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa . 10 : 2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul , and after his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons	l

of great stature , five cubits high ; and in the Egyptian ' s hand was a spear like a weaver ' s beam ; and he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian ' s hand , and slew him with his own spear . 11 : 24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and had the name among the three mighties . 11 : 25 Behold , he was honourable among the thirty , but attained not to the first three : and David set him	s
, mine heart shall be knit unto you : but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies , seeing there is no wrong in mine hands , the God of our fathers look thereon , and rebuke it . 12 : 18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai , who was chief of the captains , and he said , Thine are we , David , and on thy side , thou son of Jesse : peace , peace be unto thee , and peace be to thine helpers ; for thy God helpeth thee . Then	s
David received them , and made them captains of the band . 12 : 19 And there fell some of Manasseh to David , when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle : but they helped them not : for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away , saying , He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads . 12 : 20 As he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zilthai , captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh . 12 : 21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captains in the host . 12 : 22 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him , until it was a great host , like the host of God . 12 : 23 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to Hebron	l
15 : 16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy . 15 : 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brethren , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brethren , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ; 15 : 18 And with them their brethren of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obededom , and Jeiel , the porters . 15 : 19 So the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass ; 15 : 20 And Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with psalteries on Alamoth ; 15 : 21 And Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and	l
Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine . 16 : 4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD , and to record , and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel : 16 : 5 Asaph the chief , and next to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obededom : and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps ; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals ; 16 : 6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God . 16 : 7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren . 16 : 8 Give thanks unto the LORD , call upon his name , make known his deeds among the people . 16 : 9 Sing unto him , sing psalms unto him , talk ye of all his wondrous works . 16	l
Amen , and praised the LORD . 16 : 37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the ark continually , as every day ' s work required : 16 : 38 And Obededom with their brethren , threescore and eight ; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters : 16 : 39 And Zadok the priest , and his brethren the priests , before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon , 16 : 40	s
God is with thee . 17 : 3 And it came to pass the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying , 17 : 4 Go and tell David my servant , Thus saith the LORD , Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in : 17 : 5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day ; but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tabernacle to another . 17 : 6 Wheresoever I have walked with	s
not take my mercy away from him , as I took it from him that was before thee : 17 : 14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever : and his throne shall be established for evermore . 17 : 15 According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak unto David . 17 : 16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD , and said , Who am I , O LORD God , and what is mine house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ? 17 : 17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , O God ; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant ' s house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O LORD God . 17 : 18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant ? for thou knowest thy servant . 17 : 19 O LORD , for thy servant ' s sake , and according to	l
and it shall be blessed for ever . 18 : 1 Now after this it came to pass , that David smote the Philistines , and subdued them , and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines . 18 : 2 And he smote Moab ; and the Moabites became David ' s servants , and brought gifts . 18 : 3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath , as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates . 18 : 4 And David took from him a thousand chariots	s
Hadarezer , and smitten him ; ( for Hadarezer had war with Tou ;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass . 18 : 11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek . 18 : 12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand . 18 :	s
13 And he put garrisons in Edom ; and all the Edomites became David ' s servants . Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went . 18 : 14 So David reigned over all Israel , and executed judgment and justice among all his people . 18 : 15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , recorder . 18 : 16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ; 18 : 17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king . 19 : 1 Now it came to pass after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his stead . 19 : 2 And David said , I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash , because his father shewed kindness to me . And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father . So the servants of David came into the land	l
: 5 Then there went certain , and told David how the men were served . And he sent to meet them : for the men were greatly ashamed . And the king said , Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown , and then return . 19 : 6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Syriamaachah , and out of Zobah . 19 : 7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots , and the king of Maachah and his people ; who came and pitched before Medeba . And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle . 19 : 8 And when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the host of the mighty men . 19 : 9 And the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves	l
of the LORD ; for very great are his mercies : but let me not fall into the hand of man . 21 : 14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel : and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men . 21 : 15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it : and as he was destroying , the LORD beheld , and he repented him of the evil , and said to the angel that destroyed , It is enough , stay now thine hand . And the angel of the LORD stood by the	s
threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite . 21 : 16 And David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . Then David and the elders of Israel , who were clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces . 21 : 17 And David said unto God , Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered ? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed ; but as for these sheep , what have they done ? let thine hand , I pray thee , O LORD my God , be on me , and on my father ' s house ; but not on thy people , that they should be plagued . 21 : 18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite . 21 : 19 And David went up at the saying of Gad , which he spake in the name	l
of the LORD . 21 : 20 And Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons with him hid themselves . Now Ornan was threshing wheat . 21 : 21 And as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground . 21 : 22 Then David said to Ornan , Grant me the place of this threshingfloor , that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD : thou shalt grant it me	s
for the full price : that the plague may be stayed from the people . 21 : 23 And Ornan said unto David , Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes : lo , I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; I give it all . 21 : 24 And king David said to Ornan , Nay ; but I will verily buy it for the full price : for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD , nor offer burnt offerings without cost . 21 : 25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight . 21 : 26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the LORD ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering . 21 : 27 And the LORD commanded the angel ; and he put up his sword again into the sheath	l
thereof . 21 : 28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there . 21 : 29 For the tabernacle of the LORD , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering , were at that season in the high place at Gibeon . 21 : 30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God : for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD . 22 : 1 Then	s
to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God : 22 : 8 But the word of the LORD came to me , saying , Thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast made great wars : thou shalt not build an house unto my name , because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight . 22 : 9 Behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and	s
hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance : timber also and stone have I prepared ; and thou mayest add thereto . 22 : 15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance , hewers and workers of stone and timber , and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work . 22 : 16 Of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . Arise therefore ,	s
and be doing , and the LORD be with thee . 22 : 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying , 22 : 18 Is not the LORD your God with you ? and hath he not given you rest on every side ? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand ; and the land is subdued before the LORD , and before his people . 22 : 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God ; arise therefore , and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God , to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and the holy vessels of God , into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD . 23 : 1 So when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel . 23 : 2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel , with the priests and the Levites . 23 : 3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and	l
upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand . 23 : 4 Of which , twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD ; and six thousand were officers and judges : 23 : 5 Moreover four thousand were porters ; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made , said David , to praise therewith . 23 : 6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi , namely , Gershon , Kohath ,	s
they shall no more carry the tabernacle , nor any vessels of it for the service thereof . 23 : 27 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above : 23 : 28 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD , in the courts , and in the chambers , and in the purifying of all holy things , and the work of the service of the house of God ; 23 : 29 Both for the shewbread	s
and Nethaneel the fifth . 26 : 5 Ammiel the sixth , Issachar the seventh , Peulthai the eighth : for God blessed him . 26 : 6 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of valour . 26 : 7 The sons of Shemaiah ; Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brethren were strong men , Elihu , and Semachiah . 26 : 8 All these of the sons of Obededom : they and their sons and their brethren , able men for strength for the service , were threescore and two of Obededom . 26 : 9 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren , strong men , eighteen . 26 : 10 Also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ;) 26 : 11 Hilkiah the second , Tebaliah the third , Zechariah the fourth : all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen . 26 : 12 Among these were the	l
divisions of the porters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the LORD . 26 : 13 And they cast lots , as well the small as the great , according to the house of their fathers , for every gate . 26 : 14 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah . Then for Zechariah his son , a wise counsellor , they cast lots ; and his lot came out northward . 26 : 15 To Obededom southward ; and to his sons the house of	s
Asuppim . 26 : 16 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward , with the gate Shallecheth , by the causeway of the going up , ward against ward . 26 : 17 Eastward were six Levites , northward four a day , southward four a day , and toward Asuppim two and two . 26 : 18 At Parbar westward , four at the causeway , and two at Parbar . 26 : 19 These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore , and among the sons of Merari . 26 : 20 And of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things . 26 : 21 As concerning the sons of Laadan ; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan , chief fathers , even of Laadan the Gershonite , were Jehieli . 26 : 22 The sons of Jehieli ; Zetham , and Joel his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD . 26 : 23 Of the Amramites , and the Izharites , the Hebronites , and the Uzzielites : 26	l
: 24 And Shebuel the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , was ruler of the treasures . 26 : 25 And his brethren by Eliezer ; Rehabiah his son , and Jeshaiah his son , and Joram his son , and Zichri his son , and Shelomith his son . 26 : 26 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated . 26 :	s
. 27 : 8 The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite : and in his course were twenty and four thousand . 27 : 9 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite : and in his course were twenty and four thousand . 27 : 10 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand . 27 : 11 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite	s
Solomon my son , know thou the God of thy father , and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind : for the LORD searcheth all hearts , and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts : if thou seek him , he will be found of thee ; but if thou forsake him , he will cast thee off for ever . 28 : 10 Take heed now ; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary : be strong , and do it . 28 : 11 Then David	s
willing skilful man , for any manner of service : also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment . 29 : 1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation , Solomon my son , whom alone God hath chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great : for the palace is not for man , but for the LORD God . 29 : 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold ,	s
LORD , by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite . 29 : 9 Then the people rejoiced , for that they offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy . 29 : 10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation : and David said , Blessed be thou , LORD God of Israel our father , for ever and ever . 29 : 11 Thine , O LORD is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , O LORD , and thou art exalted as head above all . 29 : 12 Both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all . 29 : 13 Now therefore , our God , we thank thee , and praise thy glorious name . 29 :	l
, and Zadok to be priest . 29 : 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him . 29 : 24 And all the princes , and the mighty men , and all the sons likewise of king David , submitted themselves unto Solomon the king . 29 : 25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel . 29 : 26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel . 29 : 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem . 29 : 28 And he died in a good old age , full of days , riches , and honour : and Solomon his son reigned in his stead . 29 : 29 Now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of	l
this thy people , that is so great ? 1 : 11 And God said to Solomon , Because this was in thine heart , and thou hast not asked riches , wealth , or honour , nor the life of thine enemies , neither yet hast asked long life ; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself , that thou mayest judge my people , over whom I have made thee king : 1 : 12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like . 1 : 13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the congregation , and reigned over Israel . 1 : 14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , which he placed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem . 1 : 15 And	l
to six hundred talents . 3 : 9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold . 3 : 10 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work , and overlaid them with gold . 3 : 11 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long : one wing of the one cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other	s
11 And Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basons . And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ; 4 : 12 To wit , the two pillars , and the pommels , and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars , and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars ; 4 : 13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths ; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath , to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars . 4 : 14 He made also bases , and lavers made he upon the bases ; 4 : 15 One sea , and twelve oxen under it . 4 : 16 The pots also , and the shovels , and the fleshhooks , and all their instruments , did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass . 4 : 17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground	l
between Succoth and Zeredathah . 4 : 18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance : for the weight of the brass could not be found out . 4 : 19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden altar also , and the tables whereon the shewbread was set ; 4 : 20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps , that they should burn after the manner before the oracle , of pure gold ; 4 : 21 And the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs	s
of Asaph , of Heman , of Jeduthun , with their sons and their brethren , being arrayed in white linen , having cymbals and psalteries and harps , stood at the east end of the altar , and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets :) 5 : 13 It came even to pass , as the trumpeters and singers were as one , to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD ; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick , and	s
or of all thy people Israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house : 6 : 30 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men :) 6 : 31 That they may fear thee , to walk in thy ways , so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers . 6 : 32 Moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of thy people Israel , but is come from a far country for thy great name ' s sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ; 6 : 33 Then hear thou from the heavens , even from thy dwelling place , and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for ; that all people of the earth may know thy name , and fear thee , as	l
Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel , 8 : 8 But of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day . 8 : 9 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen . 8 : 10 And these were the chief of	s
me . And they obeyed the words of the LORD , and returned from going against Jeroboam . 11 : 5 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem , and built cities for defence in Judah . 11 : 6 He built even Bethlehem , and Etam , and Tekoa , 11 : 7 And Bethzur , and Shoco , and Adullam , 11 : 8 And Gath , and Mareshah , and Ziph , 11 : 9 And Adoraim , and Lachish , and Azekah , 11 : 10 And Zorah , and Aijalon , and Hebron , which are in	s
David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord . 13 : 7 And there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them . 13 : 8 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye be a great multitude , and there are with your golden calves , which Jeroboam made you for gods . 13 : 9 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands ? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams , the same may be a priest of them that are no gods . 13 : 10 But as for us , the LORD is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and the priests , which minister unto the LORD , are the sons of	l
when they saw that the LORD his God was with him . 15 : 10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa . 15 : 11 And they offered unto the LORD the same time , of the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep . 15 : 12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ; 15 : 13 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman . 15 : 14 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets . 15 : 15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the LORD gave them rest round about . 15 : 16 And also concerning Maachah the	l
Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself unto the LORD ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour . 17 : 17 And of Benjamin ; Eliada a mighty man of valour , and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand . 17 : 18 And next him was Jehozabad , and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war . 17 : 19 These waited on the king , beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah . 18 :	s
, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides , that we might enquire of him ? 18 : 7 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , There is yet one man , by whom we may enquire of the LORD : but I hate him ; for he never prophesied good unto me , but always evil : the same is Micaiah the son of Imla . And Jehoshaphat said , Let not the king say so . 18 : 8 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers , and said	s
mouth of all his prophets . And the Lord said , Thou shalt entice him , and thou shalt also prevail : go out , and do even so . 18 : 22 Now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee . 18 : 23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and smote Micaiah upon the cheek , and said , Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee ? 18	s
Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him , saying , Fight ye not with small or great , save only with the king of Israel . 18 : 31 And it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel . Therefore they compassed about him to fight : but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the LORD helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him . 18 : 32 For it came to pass	s
, that , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him . 18 : 33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded . 18 : 34 And the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died . 19 : 1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem . 19 : 2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , Shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love them that hate the LORD ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD . 19 : 3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that	l
to say , Praise the LORD ; for his mercy endureth for ever . 20 : 22 And when they began to sing and to praise , the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , which were come against Judah ; and they were smitten . 20 : 23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to destroy another .	s
20 : 24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped . 20 : 25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them , they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies , and precious jewels , which they stripped off for themselves , more than they could carry away : and they were three days in gathering of the spoil , it was so much . 20 : 26 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day . 20 : 27 Then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies . 20 : 28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps	l
and trumpets unto the house of the LORD . 20 : 29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel . 20 : 30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet : for his God gave him rest round about . 20 : 31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . And his mother ' s name was Azubah	s
see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel , because he was sick . 22 : 7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram : for when he was come , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi , whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab . 22 : 8 And it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them . 22 : 9 And he sought Ahaziah : and they caught him , ( for he was hid in Samaria ,) and brought him to Jehu : and when they had slain him , they buried him : Because , said they , he is the son of Jehoshaphat , who sought the LORD with all his heart . So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom . 22 : 10 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose	l
hid in the house of God six years : and Athaliah reigned over the land . 23 : 1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into covenant with him . 23 : 2 And they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem . 23 : 3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . And he said unto them , Behold , the king ' s son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David . 23 : 4 This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the doors ; 23 : 5 And a third	l
part shall be at the king ' s house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD . 23 : 6 But let none come into the house of the LORD , save the priests , and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD . 23 : 7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about , every man	s
the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the LORD : and they came through the high gate into the king ' s house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom . 23 : 21 And all the people of the land rejoiced : and the city was quiet , after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword . 24 : 1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem . His mother ' s name also was Zibiah of Beersheba . 24 : 2 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest . 24 : 3 And Jehoiada took for him two wives ; and he begat sons and daughters . 24 : 4 And it came to pass after this , that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD . 24 : 5 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites ,	l
and said to them , Go out unto the cities of Judah , and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year , and see that ye hasten the matter . Howbeit the Levites hastened it not . 24 : 6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief , and said unto him , Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection , according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD , and of the congregation	s
of Israel , for the tabernacle of witness ? 24 : 7 For the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim . 24 : 8 And at the king ' s commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD . 24 : 9 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness . 24 : 10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end . 24 : 11 Now it came to pass , that at what time the chest was brought unto the king ' s office by the hand of the Levites , and when they saw that there was much money , the king ' s scribe and the high priest ' s officer came and emptied the chest , and	l
conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest , and slew him on his bed , and he died : and they buried him in the city of David , but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings . 24 : 26 And these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess . 24 : 27 Now concerning his sons , and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him , and the repairing of the house	s
to Samaria . 25 : 25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years . 25 : 26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ? 25 : 27 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent to Lachish after	s
all that David his father had done . 29 : 3 He in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the LORD , and repaired them . 29 : 4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the east street , 29 : 5 And said unto them , Hear me , ye Levites , sanctify now yourselves , and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers , and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place . 29 : 6 For our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD , and turned their backs . 29 : 7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel . 29 : 8 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah	l
ever : and serve the LORD your God , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you . 30 : 9 For if ye turn again unto the LORD , your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive , so that they shall come again into this land : for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful , and will not turn away his face from you , if ye return unto him . 30 : 10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim	s
prayed for them , saying , The good LORD pardon every one 30 : 19 That prepareth his heart to seek God , the LORD God of his fathers , though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary . 30 : 20 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah , and healed the people . 30 : 21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the LORD . 30 : 22 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers . 30 : 23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days : and they kept other seven days with gladness . 30 : 24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the	l
all Judah , and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God . 31 : 21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered . 32 : 1 After these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself . 32 : 2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem , 32 : 3 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city : and they did help him . 32 : 4 So there was gathered much people together , who stopped all the fountains , and the brook that ran through the midst of the land , saying , Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ?	l
32 : 30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David . And Hezekiah prospered in all his works . 32 : 31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart . 32 : 32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his goodness , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel . 32 : 33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death . And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead . 33 : 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and he	l
the book of the kings of Israel . 33 : 19 His prayer also , and how God was intreated of him , and all his sins , and his trespass , and the places wherein he built high places , and set up groves and graven images , before he was humbled : behold , they are written among the sayings of the seers . 33 : 20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house : and Amon his son reigned in his stead . 33 : 21 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned two years in Jerusalem . 33 : 22 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ; 33 : 23 And humbled not himself before the LORD , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but Amon trespassed more and more . 33 : 24 And his servants conspired against him , and slew him in his	l
brought into the house of God , which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim , and of all the remnant of Israel , and of all Judah and Benjamin ; and they returned to Jerusalem . 34 : 10 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house : 34 : 11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it , to buy hewn stone , and timber for couplings , and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed . 34 : 12 And the men did the work faithfully : and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah , the Levites , of the sons of Merari ; and Zechariah and Meshullam , of the sons of the Kohathites , to set it forward ; and other of the Levites , all that could skill of instruments of musick . 34 : 13 Also they were over the bearers of	l
And the king went up into the house of the LORD , and all the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and the priests , and the Levites , and all the people , great and small : and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD . 34 : 31 And the king stood in his place , and made a covenant before the LORD , to walk after the LORD , and to keep his commandments , and his testimonies , and his statutes , with all his heart , and with all his soul , to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book . 34 : 32 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it . And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers . 34 : 33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel , and made all that were present in Israel	l
his God . 36 : 6 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon . 36 : 7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon . 36 : 8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead . 36 : 9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD . 36 : 10 And when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem . 36 : 11 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began	l
writing , saying , 1 : 2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia , The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah . 1 : 3 Who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of the LORD God of Israel , ( he is the God ,) which is in Jerusalem	s
. 1 : 4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth , let the men of his place help him with silver , and with gold , and with goods , and with beasts , beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem . 1 : 5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , with all them whose spirit God had raised , to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem . 1 : 6 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered . 1 : 7 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD , which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem , and had put them in the house of his gods ; 1 : 8 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them	l
the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities . 3 : 1 And when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem . 3 : 2 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren the priests , and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and his brethren , and builded the altar of the God of Israel , to offer	s
oil , unto them of Zidon , and to them of Tyre , to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa , according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia . 3 : 8 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem , in the second month , began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites , and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem	s
the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions ; the Dinaites , the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Susanchites , the Dehavites , and the Elamites , 4 : 10 And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over , and set in the cities of Samaria , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time . 4 : 11 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto Artaxerxes the king ; Thy servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time . 4 : 12 Be it known unto the king , that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem , building the rebellious and the bad city , and have set up the walls thereof , and joined the foundations . 4 : 13 Be it known now unto the king , that , if this city be builded , and the walls set up again , then will they not	l
pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings . 4 : 14 Now because we have maintenance from the king ' s palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king ' s dishonour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ; 4 : 15 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers : so shalt thou find in the book of the records , and know that this city is a rebellious city , and hurtful unto	s
force and power . 4 : 24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem . So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia . 5 : 1 Then the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them . 5 : 2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of God helping them . 5 : 3 At the same time came to them Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shetharboznai and their companions , and said thus unto them , Who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ? 5 : 4 Then said we unto them after this manner , What are the names of the men that make this building ? 5 : 5 But the eye of their	l
the people away into Babylon . 5 : 13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God . 5 : 14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought them into the temple of Babylon , those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered unto one , whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had	s
that whosoever shall alter this word , let timber be pulled down from his house , and being set up , let him be hanged thereon ; and let his house be made a dunghill for this . 6 : 12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people , that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem . I Darius have made a decree ; let it be done with speed . 6 : 13 Then Tatnai , governor on this side the river , Shetharboznai , and their companions , according to that which Darius the king had sent , so they did speedily . 6 : 14 And the elders of the Jews builded , and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo . And they builded , and finished it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the commandment of Cyrus , and Darius , and Artaxerxes king of Persia . 6 : 15 And this house was finished on the third	l
day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king . 6 : 16 And the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy . 6 : 17 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he goats , according to the number of	s
the tribes of Israel . 6 : 18 And they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses . 6 : 19 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month . 6 : 20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves . 6 : 21 And the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the LORD God of Israel , did eat , 6 : 22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy : for the LORD had made them joyful , and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them , to strengthen their hands in the work of the house	l
lords , and all Israel there present , had offered : 8 : 26 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels an hundred talents , and of gold an hundred talents ; 8 : 27 Also twenty basons of gold , of a thousand drams ; and two vessels of fine copper , precious as gold . 8 : 28 And I said unto them , Ye are holy unto the LORD ; the vessels are holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers . 8 : 29 Watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the LORD . 8 : 30 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God . 8 : 31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on	l
the twelfth day of the first month , to go unto Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way . 8 : 32 And we came to Jerusalem , and abode there three days . 8 : 33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest ; and with him was	s
even of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians , and the Amorites . 9 : 2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass . 9 : 3 And when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of	s
all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ; 10 : 8 And that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away . 10 : 9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days . It was the ninth month , on the twentieth day of the month ; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God , trembling because of this matter , and for the great rain . 10 : 10 And Ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , Ye have transgressed , and have taken strange wives , to increase the trespass of Israel . 10 : 11 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives . 10 : 12 Then all the congregation answered and said with	l
, ( the queen also sitting by him ,) For how long shall thy journey be ? and when wilt thou return ? So it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time . 2 : 7 Moreover I said unto the king , If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over till I come into Judah ; 2 : 8 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king ' s forest , that he may give	s
me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house , and for the wall of the city , and for the house that I shall enter into . And the king granted me , according to the good hand of my God upon me . 2 : 9 Then I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king ' s letters . Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me . 2 : 10 When Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel . 2 : 11 So I came to Jerusalem , and was there three days . 2 : 12 And I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem : neither was there any beast with me , save the beast that I rode upon . 2 : 13 And I	l
prayer unto our God , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them . 4 : 10 And Judah said , The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed , and there is much rubbish ; so that we are not able to build the wall . 4 : 11 And our adversaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among them , and slay them , and cause the work to cease . 4 : 12 And it came to pass , that when	s
the Jews which dwelt by them came , they said unto us ten times , From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you . 4 : 13 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows . 4 : 14 And I looked , and rose up , and said unto the nobles , and to the rulers , and to the rest of the people , Be not ye afraid of them : remember the LORD , which is great and terrible , and fight for your brethren , your sons , and your daughters , your wives , and your houses . 4 : 15 And it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work . 4 : 16 And it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants	l
the king ' s tribute , and that upon our lands and vineyards . 5 : 5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren , our children as their children : and , lo , we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants , and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already : neither is it in our power to redeem them ; for other men have our lands and vineyards . 5 : 6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words . 5 : 7 Then I consulted with myself , and I rebuked the nobles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Ye exact usury , every one of his brother . And I set a great assembly against them . 5 : 8 And I said unto them , We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews , which were sold unto the heathen ; and will ye even sell your brethren ? or shall they be sold unto us ? Then held they their peace , and found nothing to answer . 5 : 9	l
I sent messengers unto them , saying , I am doing a great work , so that I cannot come down : why should the work cease , whilst I leave it , and come down to you ? 6 : 4 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort ; and I answered them after the same manner . 6 : 5 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand ; 6 : 6 Wherein was written , It is reported among the heathen ,	s
: 47 The children of Keros , the children of Sia , the children of Padon , 7 : 48 The children of Lebana , the children of Hagaba , the children of Shalmai , 7 : 49 The children of Hanan , the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar , 7 : 50 The children of Reaiah , the children of Rezin , the children of Nekoda , 7 : 51 The children of Gazzam , the children of Uzza , the children of Phaseah , 7 : 52 The children of Besai , the children of Meunim , the children of Nephishesim , 7 : 53 The children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur , 7 : 54 The children of Bazlith , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha , 7 : 55 The children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Tamah , 7 : 56 The children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha . 7 : 57 The children of Solomon ' s servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Perida ,	l
7 : 58 The children of Jaala , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel , 7 : 59 The children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Amon . 7 : 60 All the Nethinims , and the children of Solomon ' s servants , were three hundred ninety and two . 7 : 61 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah , Telharesha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer : but they could not shew their father ' s house ,	s
saying , Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye grieved . 8 : 12 And all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them . 8 : 13 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , unto Ezra the scribe , even to understand the words of the law . 8 : 14 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month : 8 : 15 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities , and in Jerusalem , saying , Go forth unto the mount , and fetch olive branches , and pine branches , and myrtle branches , and palm branches , and branches of thick trees , to make booths , as it is written . 8 : 16 So the people went	l
, and true laws , good statutes and commandments : 9 : 14 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath , and commandedst them precepts , statutes , and laws , by the hand of Moses thy servant : 9 : 15 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them . 9 : 16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly , and hardened their necks , and hearkened not to thy commandments , 9 : 17 And refused to obey , neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them ; but hardened their necks , and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage : but thou art a God ready to pardon , gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and forsookest them not . 9 : 18 Yea , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , This is thy God that brought thee up	l
of the kings of Assyria unto this day . 9 : 33 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for thou hast done right , but we have done wickedly : 9 : 34 Neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept thy law , nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them . 9 : 35 For they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works . 9 : 36 Behold , we are servants this day , and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are servants in it : 9 : 37 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in	l
their nobles , and entered into a curse , and into an oath , to walk in God ' s law , which was given by Moses the servant of God , and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord , and his judgments and his statutes ; 10 : 30 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , not take their daughters for our sons : 10 : 31 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell , that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath , or on the holy day : and that we would leave the seventh year , and the exaction of every debt . 10 : 32 Also we made ordinances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ; 10 : 33 For the shewbread , and for the continual meat offering , and for the continual burnt offering , of the sabbaths , of the new moons , for the set feasts	l
, and for the holy things , and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel , and for all the work of the house of our God . 10 : 34 And we cast the lots among the priests , the Levites , and the people , for the wood offering , to bring it into the house of our God , after the houses of our fathers , at times appointed year by year , to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God , as it is written in the law : 10 :	s
35 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground , and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees , year by year , unto the house of the LORD : 10 : 36 Also the firstborn of our sons , and of our cattle , as it is written in the law , and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks , to bring to the house of our God , unto the priests that minister in the house of our God : 10 : 37 And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough , and our offerings , and the fruit of all manner of trees , of wine and of oil , unto the priests , to the chambers of the house of our God ; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites , that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage . 10 : 38 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God , to	l
in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four . 11 : 19 Moreover the porters , Akkub , Talmon , and their brethren that kept the gates , were an hundred seventy and two . 11 : 20 And the residue of Israel , of the priests , and the Levites , were in all the cities of Judah , every one in his inheritance . 11 : 21 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel : and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims . 11 : 22 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micha . Of the sons of Asaph , the singers were over the business of the house of God . 11 : 23 For it was the king ' s commandment concerning them , that a certain portion should be for the singers , due for every day . 11 : 24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel , of the children of Zerah the son of Judah , was at the king ' s hand in all matters concerning the people	l
. 11 : 25 And for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba , and in the villages thereof , and at Dibon , and in the villages thereof , and at Jekabzeel , and in the villages thereof , 11 : 26 And at Jeshua , and at Moladah , and at Bethphelet , 11 : 27 And at Hazarshual , and at Beersheba , and in the villages thereof , 11 : 28 And at Ziklag , and at Mekonah , and in the villages thereof , 11 :	s
to the reign of Darius the Persian . 12 : 23 The sons of Levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib . 12 : 24 And the chief of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , ward over against ward . 12 : 25 Mattaniah , and Bakbukiah	s
for Tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God . 13 : 8 And it grieved me sore : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber . 13 : 9 Then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frankincense . 13 : 10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers ,	s
figs , and all manner of burdens , which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day : and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals . 13 : 16 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish , and all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem . 13 : 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said unto them , What evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ? 13	s
every one in his business ; 13 : 31 And for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the firstfruits . Remember me , O my God , for good . The Book of Esther 1 : 1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus , ( this is Ahasuerus which reigned , from India even unto Ethiopia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces :) 1 : 2 That in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace	s
before him , but she came not . 1 : 18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king ' s princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath . 1 : 19 If it please the king , let there go a royal commandment from him , and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes , that it be not altered , That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus ; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she . 1 : 20 And when the king ' s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great ,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small . 1 : 21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did according to the word of Memucan : 1 : 22 For he sent letters into all the king ' s provinces , into every province	l
according to the writing thereof , and to every people after their language , that every man should bear rule in his own house , and that it should be published according to the language of every people . 2 : 1 After these things , when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her . 2 : 2 Then said the king ' s servants that ministered unto him , Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king : 2 :	s
3 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom , that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace , to the house of the women , unto the custody of Hege the king ' s chamberlain , keeper of the women ; and let their things for purification be given them : 2 : 4 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti . And the thing pleased the king ; and he did so . 2 : 5 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ; 2 : 6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away . 2 : 7 And he brought up Hadassah , that is , Esther , his uncle ' s daughter : for she had neither father nor mother , and the maid was fair and beautiful ; whom	l
Mordecai , when her father and mother were dead , took for his own daughter . 2 : 8 So it came to pass , when the king ' s commandment and his decree was heard , and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace , to the custody of Hegai , that Esther was brought also unto the king ' s house , to the custody of Hegai , keeper of the women . 2 : 9 And the maiden pleased him , and she obtained kindness of him ; and he speedily gave her her	s
with her out of the house of the women unto the king ' s house . 2 : 14 In the evening she went , and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women , to the custody of Shaashgaz , the king ' s chamberlain , which kept the concubines : she came in unto the king no more , except the king delighted in her , and that she were called by name . 2 : 15 Now when the turn of Esther , the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai , who	s
it unto Esther the queen ; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai ' s name . 2 : 23 And when inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king . 3 : 1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the princes that were with him . 3 : 2 And all the king ' s servants , that were in the king ' s gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . But Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence . 3 : 3 Then the king ' s servants , which were in the king ' s gate , said unto Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king ' s commandment ? 3 : 4 Now it came to pass , when they spake daily unto him , and he hearkened not unto them , that they told Haman , to see	l
whether Mordecai ' s matters would stand : for he had told them that he was a Jew . 3 : 5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence , then was Haman full of wrath . 3 : 6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even the people of Mordecai . 3 : 7 In the first month , that is	s
, The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee . 3 : 12 Then were the king ' s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month , and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king ' s lieutenants , and to the governors that were over every province , and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people after their language ; in the name of king	s
to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus . 6 : 3 And the king said , What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this ? Then said the king ' s servants that ministered unto him , There is nothing done for him . 6 : 4 And the king said , Who is in the court ? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king ' s house , to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him . 6 : 5 And the king ' s servants said unto him , Behold , Haman standeth in the court . And the king said , Let him come in . 6 : 6 So Haman came in . And the king said unto him , What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour ? Now Haman thought in his heart , To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself ? 6 : 7 And Haman answered the king , For the man whom the king delighteth to honour , 6 : 8 Let the royal	l
high , which Haman had made for Mordecai , who spoken good for the king , standeth in the house of Haman . Then the king said , Hang him thereon . 7 : 10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai . Then was the king ' s wrath pacified . 8 : 1 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews ' enemy unto Esther the queen . And Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was unto her . 8 : 2 And the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it unto Mordecai . And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman . 8 : 3 And Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews . 8 : 4 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther . So Esther arose , and stood before the	l
people after their language , and to the Jews according to their writing , and according to their language . 8 : 10 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king ' s ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries : 8 : 11 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together , and to stand for their life , to destroy , to slay and to cause to perish , all	s
in execution , in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them , ( though it was turned to the contrary , that the Jews had rule over them that hated them ;) 9 : 2 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people . 9 : 3 And all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them . 9 : 4 For Mordecai was great in the king ' s house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces : for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater . 9 : 5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them . 9 : 6 And in Shushan the palace the	l
king . 9 : 12 And the king said unto Esther the queen , The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace , and the ten sons of Haman ; what have they done in the rest of the king ' s provinces ? now what is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : or what is thy request further ? and it shall be done . 9 : 13 Then said Esther , If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day ' s decree , and let Haman ' s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows . 9 : 14 And the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Shushan ; and they hanged Haman ' s ten sons . 9 : 15 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand . 9 : 16 But	l
undertook to do as they had begun , and as Mordecai had written unto them ; 9 : 24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had devised against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast Pur , that is , the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ; 9 : 25 But when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and	s
the Jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth , 9 : 31 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed , according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them , and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed , the matters of the fastings and their cry . 9 : 32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim ; and it was written in the book . 10 : 1 And the king Ahasuerus	s
LORD hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the LORD . 1 : 22 In all this Job sinned not , nor charged God foolishly . 2 : 1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD . 2 : 2 And the LORD said unto Satan , From whence comest thou ? And Satan answered the LORD , and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . 2 : 3 And the LORD said unto Satan , Hast thou considered my servant Job , that there is none like him in the earth , a perfect and an upright man , one that feareth God , and escheweth evil ? and still he holdeth fast his integrity , although thou movedst me against him , to destroy him without cause . 2 : 4 And Satan answered the LORD , and said , Skin for skin , yea , all that a man hath will he give for his life . 2 :	l
5 But put forth thine hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face . 2 : 6 And the LORD said unto Satan , Behold , he is in thine hand ; but save his life . 2 : 7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown . 2 : 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal ; and he sat down among the ashes .	s
of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it . 3 : 6 As for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months . 3 : 7 Lo , let that night be solitary , let no joyful voice come therein . 3 : 8 Let them curse it that curse the day , who are ready to raise up their mourning . 3 : 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day : 3 : 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother ' s womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes . 3 : 11 Why died I not from the womb ? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly ? 3 : 12 Why did the knees prevent me ? or why the breasts that I should suck ?	l
answered and said , 4 : 2 If we assay to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieved ? but who can withhold himself from speaking ? 4 : 3 Behold , thou hast instructed many , and thou hast strengthened the weak hands . 4 : 4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling , and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees . 4 : 5 But now it is come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled . 4 : 6 Is not this thy fear , thy	s
confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy ways ? 4 : 7 Remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ? 4 : 8 Even as I have seen , they that plow iniquity , and sow wickedness , reap the same . 4 : 9 By the blast of God they perish , and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed . 4 : 10 The roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions , are broken . 4 : 11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the stout lion ' s whelps are scattered abroad . 4 : 12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me , and mine ear received a little thereof . 4 : 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night , when deep sleep falleth on men , 4 : 14 Fear came upon me , and trembling , which made all my bones to shake . 4 : 15 Then a spirit passed before my face ;	l
, whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ? 4 : 20 They are destroyed from morning to evening : they perish for ever without any regarding it . 4 : 21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away ? they die , even without wisdom . 5 : 1 Call now , if there be any that will answer thee ; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn ? 5 : 2 For wrath killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the silly one . 5 : 3 I have seen the foolish taking root : but suddenly I cursed his habitation . 5 : 4 His children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them . 5 : 5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh it even out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth up their substance . 5 : 6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust , neither doth trouble spring out of the ground ; 5 : 7 Yet man is born unto trouble ,	l
and famine thou shalt laugh : neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth . 5 : 23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee . 5 : 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin . 5 : 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth . 5 :	s
, because our days upon earth are a shadow :) 8 : 10 Shall not they teach thee , and tell thee , and utter words out of their heart ? 8 : 11 Can the rush grow up without mire ? can the flag grow without water ? 8 : 12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness , and not cut down , it withereth before any other herb . 8 : 13 So are the paths of all that forget God ; and the hypocrite ' s hope shall perish : 8 : 14 Whose hope shall	s
called , and he had answered me ; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice . 9 : 17 For he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause . 9 : 18 He will not suffer me to take my breath , but filleth me with bitterness . 9 : 19 If I speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to plead ? 9 : 20 If I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn	s
me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse . 9 : 21 Though I were perfect , yet would I not know my soul : I would despise my life . 9 : 22 This is one thing , therefore I said it , He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked . 9 : 23 If the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the innocent . 9 : 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ? 9 : 25 Now my days are swifter than a post : they flee away , they see no good . 9 : 26 They are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that hasteth to the prey . 9 : 27 If I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heaviness , and comfort myself : 9 : 28 I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent . 9	l
: 29 If I be wicked , why then labour I in vain ? 9 : 30 If I wash myself with snow water , and make my hands never so clean ; 9 : 31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch , and mine own clothes shall abhor me . 9 : 32 For he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him , and we should come together in judgment . 9 : 33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us , that might lay his hand upon us both	s
calleth upon God , and he answereth him : the just upright man is laughed to scorn . 12 : 5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease . 12 : 6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper , and they that provoke God are secure ; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly . 12 : 7 But ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee : 12 : 8	s
. 12 : 18 He looseth the bond of kings , and girdeth their loins with a girdle . 12 : 19 He leadeth princes away spoiled , and overthroweth the mighty . 12 : 20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty , and taketh away the understanding of the aged . 12 : 21 He poureth contempt upon princes , and weakeneth the strength of the mighty . 12 : 22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death . 12 : 23 He increaseth the nations ,	s
and destroyeth them : he enlargeth the nations , and straiteneth them again . 12 : 24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way . 12 : 25 They grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man . 13 : 1 Lo , mine eye hath seen all this , mine ear hath heard and understood it . 13 : 2 What ye know , the same do I know also : I am not inferior unto you . 13 : 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty , and I desire to reason with God . 13 : 4 But ye are forgers of lies , ye are all physicians of no value . 13 : 5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace ! and it should be your wisdom . 13 : 6 Hear now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips . 13 : 7 Will ye speak wickedly for God ? and talk deceitfully for him ? 13 :	l
destroyest the hope of man . 14 : 20 Thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth : thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away . 14 : 21 His sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perceiveth it not of them . 14 : 22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain , and his soul within him shall mourn . 15 : 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite , and said , 15 : 2 Should a wise man utter vain	s
knowledge , and fill his belly with the east wind ? 15 : 3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk ? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good ? 15 : 4 Yea , thou castest off fear , and restrainest prayer before God . 15 : 5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty . 15 : 6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not I : yea , thine own lips testify against thee . 15 : 7 Art thou the first man that was born ? or wast thou made before the hills ? 15 : 8 Hast thou heard the secret of God ? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself ? 15 : 9 What knowest thou , that we know not ? what understandest thou , which is not in us ? 15 : 10 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men , much elder than thy father . 15 : 11 Are the consolations of God small with thee ? is there any secret thing with thee ? 15 : 12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away ?	l
kinsfolk have failed , and my familiar friends have forgotten me . 19 : 15 They that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a stranger : I am an alien in their sight . 19 : 16 I called my servant , and he gave me no answer ; I intreated him with my mouth . 19 : 17 My breath is strange to my wife , though I intreated for the children ' s sake of mine own body . 19 : 18 Yea , young children despised me ; I arose ,	s
for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways . 21 : 15 What is the Almighty , that we should serve him ? and what profit should we have , if we pray unto him ? 21 : 16 Lo , their good is not in their hand : the counsel of the wicked is far from me . 21 : 17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out ! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them ! God distributeth sorrows in his anger . 21 : 18 They are as stubble before the wind , and as chaff that the storm carrieth away . 21 : 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children : he rewardeth him , and he shall know it . 21 : 20 His eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty . 21 : 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ? 21 : 22 Shall any teach God knowledge ? seeing he judgeth those that are high . 21 : 23	l
words in thine heart . 22 : 23 If thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up , thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles . 22 : 24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust , and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks . 22 : 25 Yea , the Almighty shall be thy defence , and thou shalt have plenty of silver . 22 : 26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto God . 22 : 27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows . 22 : 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways . 22 : 29 When men are cast down , then thou shalt say , There is lifting up ; and he shall save the humble person . 22 : 30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent : and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands . 23	l
from the hungry ; 24 : 11 Which make oil within their walls , and tread their winepresses , and suffer thirst . 24 : 12 Men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out : yet God layeth not folly to them . 24 : 13 They are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof . 24 : 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a	s
he riseth up , and no man is sure of life . 24 : 23 Though it be given him to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet his eyes are upon their ways . 24 : 24 They are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn . 24 : 25 And if it be not so now , who will make me a liar , and make my speech	s
? 26 : 5 Dead things are formed from under the waters , and the inhabitants thereof . 26 : 6 Hell is naked before him , and destruction hath no covering . 26 : 7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place , and hangeth the earth upon nothing . 26 : 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds ; and the cloud is not rent under them . 26 : 9 He holdeth back the face of his throne , and spreadeth his cloud upon it . 26 : 10 He hath compassed	s
not be gathered : he openeth his eyes , and he is not . 27 : 20 Terrors take hold on him as waters , a tempest stealeth him away in the night . 27 : 21 The east wind carrieth him away , and he departeth : and as a storm hurleth him out of his place . 27 : 22 For God shall cast upon him , and not spare : he would fain flee out of his hand . 27 : 23 Men shall clap their hands at him , and shall hiss him out of his	s
place . 28 : 1 Surely there is a vein for the silver , and a place for gold where they fine it . 28 : 2 Iron is taken out of the earth , and brass is molten out of the stone . 28 : 3 He setteth an end to darkness , and searcheth out all perfection : the stones of darkness , and the shadow of death . 28 : 4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant ; even the waters forgotten of the foot : they are dried up , they are gone away from men . 28 : 5 As for the earth , out of it cometh bread : and under it is turned up as it were fire . 28 : 6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires : and it hath dust of gold . 28 : 7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture ' s eye hath not seen : 28 : 8 The lion ' s whelps have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion passed by it . 28 : 9 He putteth forth his hand upon	l
the rock ; he overturneth the mountains by the roots . 28 : 10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks ; and his eye seeth every precious thing . 28 : 11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing ; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light . 28 : 12 But where shall wisdom be found ? and where is the place of understanding ? 28 : 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither is it found in the land of the living . 28 : 14 The depth saith , It is	s
peace , and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth . 29 : 11 When the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me : 29 : 12 Because I delivered the poor that cried , and the fatherless , and him that had none to help him . 29 : 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me : and I caused the widow ' s heart to sing for joy . 29 : 14 I put on righteousness	s
: 12 Upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction . 30 : 13 They mar my path , they set forward my calamity , they have no helper . 30 : 14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me . 30 : 15 Terrors are turned upon me : they pursue my soul as the wind : and my welfare passeth away as a cloud . 30 : 16	s
mine increase . 31 : 13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant , when they contended with me ; 31 : 14 What then shall I do when God riseth up ? and when he visiteth , what shall I answer him ? 31 : 15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him ? and did not one fashion us in the womb ? 31 : 16 If I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ; 31 : 17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof ; 31 : 18 ( For from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother ' s womb ;) 31 : 19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or any poor without covering ; 31 : 20 If his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep ; 31 : 21 If I have	l
waited for your words ; I gave ear to your reasons , whilst ye searched out what to say . 32 : 12 Yea , I attended unto you , and , behold , there was none of you that convinced Job , or that answered his words : 32 : 13 Lest ye should say , We have found out wisdom : God thrusteth him down , not man . 32 : 14 Now he hath not directed his words against me : neither will I answer him with your speeches . 32 : 15 They were amazed , they answered no more : they left off speaking . 32 : 16 When I had waited , ( for they spake not , but stood still , and answered no more ;) 32 : 17 I said , I will answer also my part , I also will shew mine opinion . 32 : 18 For I am full of matter , the spirit within me constraineth me . 32 : 19 Behold , my belly is as wine which hath no vent ; it is ready to burst like new bottles . 32 : 20 I will speak	l
, that I may be refreshed : I will open my lips and answer . 32 : 21 Let me not , I pray you , accept any man ' s person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man . 32 : 22 For I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away . 33 : 1 Wherefore , Job , I pray thee , hear my speeches , and hearken to all my words . 33 : 2 Behold , now I have opened my mouth , my	s
and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and pass away : and the mighty shall be taken away without hand . 34 : 21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man , and he seeth all his goings . 34 : 22 There is no darkness , nor shadow of death , where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves . 34 : 23 For he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should enter into judgment with God . 34 : 24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number	s
Should it be according to thy mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou knowest . 34 : 34 Let men of understanding tell me , and let a wise man hearken unto me . 34 : 35 Job hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were without wisdom . 34 : 36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men . 34 : 37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin ,	s
they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge . 36 : 13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath : they cry not when he bindeth them . 36 : 14 They die in youth , and their life is among the unclean . 36 : 15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction , and openeth their ears in oppression . 36 : 16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness . 36 : 17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold on thee . 36 : 18 Because there is wrath , beware lest he take thee away with his stroke : then a great ransom cannot deliver thee . 36 : 19 Will he esteem thy riches ? no , not gold , nor all the forces of strength . 36 : 20 Desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place . 36 : 21	l
to meet the armed men . 39 : 22 He mocketh at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he back from the sword . 39 : 23 The quiver rattleth against him , the glittering spear and the shield . 39 : 24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet . 39 : 25 He saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting . 39 :	s
rage of thy wrath : and behold every one that is proud , and abase him . 40 : 12 Look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tread down the wicked in their place . 40 : 13 Hide them in the dust together ; and bind their faces in secret . 40 : 14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee . 40 : 15 Behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox . 40 : 16 Lo now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the navel of his belly . 40 : 17 He moveth his tail like a cedar : the sinews of his stones are wrapped together . 40 : 18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron . 40 : 19 He is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him . 40 : 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food , where	l
the sacrifices of righteousness , and put your trust in the LORD . 4 : 6 There be many that say , Who will shew us any good ? LORD , lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us . 4 : 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart , more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased . 4 : 8 I will both lay me down in peace , and sleep : for thou , LORD , only makest me dwell in safety . 5 : 1 Give ear to my	s
done this ; if there be iniquity in my hands ; 7 : 4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy :) 7 : 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul , and take it ; yea , let him tread down my life upon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust . Selah . 7 : 6 Arise , O LORD , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded . 7 : 7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about : for their sakes therefore return thou on high . 7 : 8 The LORD shall judge the people : judge me , O LORD , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me . 7 : 9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end ; but establish the just : for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins . 7 : 10	l
that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou , LORD , hast not forsaken them that seek thee . 9 : 11 Sing praises to the LORD , which dwelleth in Zion : declare among the people his doings . 9 : 12 When he maketh inquisition for blood , he remembereth them : he forgetteth not the cry of the humble . 9 : 13 Have mercy upon me , O LORD ; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me , thou that liftest me up from the gates of	s
death : 9 : 14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion : I will rejoice in thy salvation . 9 : 15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken . 9 : 16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . Higgaion . Selah . 9 : 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God . 9 : 18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten : the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever . 9 : 19 Arise , O LORD ; let not man prevail : let the heathen be judged in thy sight . 9 : 20 Put them in fear , O LORD : that the nations may know themselves to be but men . Selah . 10 : 1 Why standest thou afar off , O LORD ? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble ? 10 : 2 The wicked	l
Thou wilt not require it . 10 : 14 Thou hast seen it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with thy hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless . 10 : 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man : seek out his wickedness till thou find none . 10 : 16 The LORD is King for ever and ever : the heathen are perished out of his land . 10 : 17 LORD , thou hast heard the desire of the	s
righteous LORD loveth righteousness ; his countenance doth behold the upright . 12 : 1 Help , LORD ; for the godly man ceaseth ; for the faithful fail from among the children of men . 12 : 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour : with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak . 12 : 3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that speaketh proud things : 12 : 4 Who have said , With our tongue will we prevail ; our lips are our own :	s
my soul in hell ; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption . 16 : 11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life : in thy presence is fulness of joy ; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore . 17 : 1 Hear the right , O LORD , attend unto my cry , give ear unto my prayer , that goeth not out of feigned lips . 17 : 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence ; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal . 17 : 3	s
have now compassed us in our steps : they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth ; 17 : 12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey , and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places . 17 : 13 Arise , O LORD , disappoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which is thy sword : 17 : 14 From men which are thy hand , O LORD , from men of the world , which have their portion in this life , and	s
whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure : they are full of children , and leave the rest of their substance to their babes . 17 : 15 As for me , I will behold thy face in righteousness : I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with thy likeness . 18 : 1 I will love thee , O LORD , my strength . 18 : 2 The LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower . 18 : 3 I will call upon the LORD , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies . 18 : 4 The sorrows of death compassed me , and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid . 18 : 5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about : the snares of death prevented me . 18 : 6 In my distress I called upon the LORD , and cried unto my God : he heard my voice out of	l
save our God ? 18 : 32 It is God that girdeth me with strength , and maketh my way perfect . 18 : 33 He maketh my feet like hinds ' feet , and setteth me upon my high places . 18 : 34 He teacheth my hands to war , so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms . 18 : 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy right hand hath holden me up , and thy gentleness hath made me great . 18 : 36 Thou hast	s
soon as they hear of me , they shall obey me : the strangers shall submit themselves unto me . 18 : 45 The strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places . 18 : 46 The LORD liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and let the God of my salvation be exalted . 18 : 47 It is God that avengeth me , and subdueth the people under me . 18 : 48 He delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against	s
me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man . 18 : 49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the heathen , and sing praises unto thy name . 18 : 50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king ; and sheweth mercy to his anointed , to David , and to his seed for evermore . 19 : 1 The heavens declare the glory of God ; and the firmament sheweth his handywork . 19 : 2 Day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto night sheweth knowledge . 19 : 3 There is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard . 19 : 4 Their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun , 19 : 5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race . 19 : 6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is	l
ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them . 21 : 13 Be thou exalted , LORD , in thine own strength : so will we sing and praise thy power . 22 : 1 My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? why art thou so far from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ? 22 : 2 O my God , I cry in the day time , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and am not silent . 22 : 3 But thou art holy , O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel . 22 : 4 Our fathers trusted in thee : they trusted , and thou didst deliver them . 22 : 5 They cried unto thee , and were delivered : they trusted in thee , and were not confounded . 22 : 6 But I am a worm , and no man ; a reproach of men , and despised of the people . 22 : 7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn : they shoot out the lip , they shake the	l
head , saying , 22 : 8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him : let him deliver him , seeing he delighted in him . 22 : 9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb : thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother ' s breasts . 22 : 10 I was cast upon thee from the womb : thou art my God from my mother ' s belly . 22 : 11 Be not far from me ; for trouble is near ; for there is none	s

The LORD strong and mighty , the LORD mighty in battle . 24 : 9 Lift up your heads , O ye gates ; even lift them up , ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in . 24 : 10 Who is this King of glory ? The LORD of hosts , he	s
so will I compass thine altar , O LORD : 26 : 7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving , and tell of all thy wondrous works . 26 : 8 LORD , I have loved the habitation of thy house , and the place where thine honour dwelleth . 26 : 9 Gather not my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloody men : 26 : 10 In whose hands is mischief , and their right hand is full of bribes . 26 : 11 But as for me , I will walk in mine integrity : redeem me , and be merciful unto me . 26 : 12 My foot standeth in an even place : in the congregations will I bless the LORD . 27 : 1 The LORD is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? the LORD is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ? 27 : 2 When the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell . 27 : 3 Though an host should	l
me , I become like them that go down into the pit . 28 : 2 Hear the voice of my supplications , when I cry unto thee , when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle . 28 : 3 Draw me not away with the wicked , and with the workers of iniquity , which speak peace to their neighbours , but mischief is in their hearts . 28 : 4 Give them according to their deeds , and according to the wickedness of their endeavours : give them after the work of their hands ; render to them their desert . 28 : 5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD , nor the operation of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up . 28 : 6 Blessed be the LORD , because he hath heard the voice of my supplications . 28 : 7 The LORD is my strength and my shield ; my heart trusted in him , and I am helped : therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth ; and with my song will I praise him . 28 : 8 The LORD is their	l
strength , and he is the saving strength of his anointed . 28 : 9 Save thy people , and bless thine inheritance : feed them also , and lift them up for ever . 29 : 1 Give unto the LORD , O ye mighty , give unto the LORD glory and strength . 29 : 2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name ; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness . 29 : 3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters : the God of glory thundereth : the LORD is	s

Many are the afflictions of the righteous : but the LORD delivereth him out of them all . 34 : 20 He keepeth all his bones : not one of them is broken . 34 : 21 Evil shall slay the wicked : and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate . 34 : 22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants : and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate . 35 : 1 Plead my cause , O LORD , with them that strive with me : fight against them that fight against	s

O my God , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Hermonites , from the hill Mizar . 42 : 7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts : all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me . 42 : 8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life . 42 : 9 I will say	s
arise , cast us not off for ever . 44 : 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face , and forgettest our affliction and our oppression ? 44 : 25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust : our belly cleaveth unto the earth . 44 : 26 Arise for our help , and redeem us for thy mercies ' sake . 45 : 1 My heart is inditing a good matter : I speak of the things which I have made touching the king : my tongue is the pen of a ready writer . 45 : 2	s

Let mount Zion rejoice , let the daughters of Judah be glad , because of thy judgments . 48 : 12 Walk about Zion , and go round about her : tell the towers thereof . 48 : 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following . 48 : 14 For this God is our God for ever and ever : he will be our guide even unto death . 49 : 1 Hear this , all ye people ; give ear , all ye inhabitants of the	s
world : 49 : 2 Both low and high , rich and poor , together . 49 : 3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom ; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding . 49 : 4 I will incline mine ear to a parable : I will open my dark saying upon the harp . 49 : 5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil , when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about ? 49 : 6 They that trust in their wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ; 49 : 7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give to God a ransom for him : 49 : 8 ( For the redemption of their soul is precious , and it ceaseth for ever :) 49 : 9 That he should still live for ever , and not see corruption . 49 : 10 For he seeth that wise men die , likewise the fool and the brutish person perish , and leave their wealth to others . 49 : 11 Their inward thought is , that their houses shall	l

Corrupt are they , and have done abominable iniquity : there is none that doeth good . 53 : 2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , that did seek God . 53 : 3 Every one of them is gone back :	l

Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens ; let thy glory be above all the earth . 57 : 6 They have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah . 57 : 7 My heart is fixed , O God , my heart is fixed : I will sing and give praise . 57 : 8 Awake up , my glory ; awake , psaltery and harp : I myself will awake early . 57 : 9 I will praise thee , O Lord , among the people : I will sing unto thee among the nations . 57 : 10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens , and thy truth unto the clouds . 57 : 11 Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens : let thy glory be above all the earth . 58 : 1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness , O congregation ? do ye judge uprightly , O ye sons of men ? 58 : 2 Yea , in heart ye work wickedness	l
let them return ; and let them make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city . 59 : 15 Let them wander up and down for meat , and grudge if they be not satisfied . 59 : 16 But I will sing of thy power ; yea , I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning : for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble . 59 : 17 Unto thee , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence ,	s
and the God of my mercy . 60 : 1 O God , thou hast cast us off , thou hast scattered us , thou hast been displeased ; O turn thyself to us again . 60 : 2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble ; thou hast broken it : heal the breaches thereof ; for it shaketh . 60 : 3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things : thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment . 60 : 4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah . 60 : 5 That thy beloved may be delivered ; save with thy right hand , and hear me . 60 : 6 God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth . 60 : 7 Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ; 60 : 8 Moab is my washpot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe : Philistia	l
of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea : 65 : 6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains ; being girded with power : 65 : 7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas , the noise of their waves , and the tumult of the people . 65 : 8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens : thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice . 65 : 9	s
17 I cried unto him with my mouth , and he was extolled with my tongue . 66 : 18 If I regard iniquity in my heart , the Lord will not hear me : 66 : 19 But verily God hath heard me ; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer . 66 : 20 Blessed be God , which hath not turned away my prayer , nor his mercy from me . 67 : 1 God be merciful unto us , and bless us ; and cause his face to shine upon us ; Selah .	s
O Lord GOD of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O God of Israel . 69 : 7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach ; shame hath covered my face . 69 : 8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren , and an alien unto my mother ' s children . 69 : 9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up ; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me . 69 : 10 When I wept , and chastened my soul with fasting , that was to my reproach . 69 : 11 I made sackcloth also my garment ; and I became a proverb to them . 69 : 12 They that sit in the gate speak against me ; and I was the song of the drunkards . 69 : 13 But as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O LORD , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of thy salvation . 69 : 14	l
Deliver me out of the mire , and let me not sink : let me be delivered from them that hate me , and out of the deep waters . 69 : 15 Let not the waterflood overflow me , neither let the deep swallow me up , and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me . 69 : 16 Hear me , O LORD ; for thy lovingkindness is good : turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies . 69 : 17 And hide not thy face from thy servant ; for I	s
am in trouble : hear me speedily . 69 : 18 Draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver me because of mine enemies . 69 : 19 Thou hast known my reproach , and my shame , and my dishonour : mine adversaries are all before thee . 69 : 20 Reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none . 69 : 21 They gave me also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink . 69 : 22 Let their table become a snare before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap . 69 : 23 Let their eyes be darkened , that they see not ; and make their loins continually to shake . 69 : 24 Pour out thine indignation upon them , and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them . 69 : 25 Let their habitation be desolate ; and let none dwell in their tents	l
. 72 : 10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents : the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts . 72 : 11 Yea , all kings shall fall down before him : all nations shall serve him . 72 : 12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth ; the poor also , and him that hath no helper . 72 : 13 He shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of the needy . 72 : 14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and	s
as are of a clean heart . 73 : 2 But as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well nigh slipped . 73 : 3 For I was envious at the foolish , when I saw the prosperity of the wicked . 73 : 4 For there are no bands in their death : but their strength is firm . 73 : 5 They are not in trouble as other men ; neither are they plagued like other men . 73 : 6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain ; violence covereth	s
73 : 17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God ; then understood I their end . 73 : 18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places : thou castedst them down into destruction . 73 : 19 How are they brought into desolation , as in a moment ! they are utterly consumed with terrors . 73 : 20 As a dream when one awaketh ; so , O Lord , when thou awakest , thou shalt despise their image . 73 : 21 Thus my heart was grieved , and I was pricked in my reins	s
. 73 : 22 So foolish was I , and ignorant : I was as a beast before thee . 73 : 23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee : thou hast holden me by my right hand . 73 : 24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel , and afterward receive me to glory . 73 : 25 Whom have I in heaven but thee ? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee . 73 : 26 My flesh and my heart faileth : but God is the strength of my heart , and my portion for ever . 73 : 27 For , lo , they that are far from thee shall perish : thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee . 73 : 28 But it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust in the Lord GOD , that I may declare all thy works . 74 : 1 O God , why hast thou cast us off for ever ? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture ? 74 : 2 Remember thy congregation ,	l
which thou hast purchased of old ; the rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed ; this mount Zion , wherein thou hast dwelt . 74 : 3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations ; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary . 74 : 4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations ; they set up their ensigns for signs . 74 : 5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees . 74 : 6 But now they break down the	s
of the earth shall wring them out , and drink them . 75 : 9 But I will declare for ever ; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob . 75 : 10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off ; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted . 76 : 1 In Judah is God known : his name is great in Israel . 76 : 2 In Salem also is his tabernacle , and his dwelling place in Zion . 76 : 3 There brake he the arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the battle . Selah . 76 : 4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey . 76 : 5 The stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands . 76 : 6 At thy rebuke , O God of Jacob , both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep . 76 : 7 Thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in thy sight	l
is so great a God as our God ? 77 : 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders : thou hast declared thy strength among the people . 77 : 15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people , the sons of Jacob and Joseph . Selah . 77 : 16 The waters saw thee , O God , the waters saw thee ; they were afraid : the depths also were troubled . 77 : 17 The clouds poured out water : the skies sent out a sound : thine arrows also went abroad . 77 : 18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven : the lightnings lightened the world : the earth trembled and shook . 77 : 19 Thy way is in the sea , and thy path in the great waters , and thy footsteps are not known . 77 : 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron . 78 : 1 Give ear , O my people , to my law : incline your ears to the words of my mouth . 78 : 2 I will open my mouth in a	l
: 14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud , and all the night with a light of fire . 78 : 15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink as out of the great depths . 78 : 16 He brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers . 78 : 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness . 78 : 18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their	s
lust . 78 : 19 Yea , they spake against God ; they said , Can God furnish a table in the wilderness ? 78 : 20 Behold , he smote the rock , that the waters gushed out , and the streams overflowed ; can he give bread also ? can he provide flesh for his people ? 78 : 21 Therefore the LORD heard this , and was wroth : so a fire was kindled against Jacob , and anger also came up against Israel ; 78 : 22 Because they believed not in God , and trusted not in his salvation : 78 : 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above , and opened the doors of heaven , 78 : 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them of the corn of heaven . 78 : 25 Man did eat angels ' food : he sent them meat to the full . 78 : 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind . 78 : 27 He rained flesh also upon them as	l
dust , and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea : 78 : 28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their habitations . 78 : 29 So they did eat , and were well filled : for he gave them their own desire ; 78 : 30 They were not estranged from their lust . But while their meat was yet in their mouths , 78 : 31 The wrath of God came upon them , and slew the fattest of them , and smote down the chosen men of	s
us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of thy name : and deliver us , and purge away our sins , for thy name ' s sake . 79 : 10 Wherefore should the heathen say , Where is their God ? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed . 79 : 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die ; 79 :	s
joined with them : they have holpen the children of Lot . Selah . 83 : 9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites ; as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the brook of Kison : 83 : 10 Which perished at Endor : they became as dung for the earth . 83 : 11 Make their nobles like Oreb , and like Zeeb : yea , all their princes as Zebah , and as Zalmunna : 83 : 12 Who said , Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession . 83 : 13 O my God , make them like a wheel ; as the stubble before the wind . 83 : 14 As the fire burneth a wood , and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire ; 83 : 15 So persecute them with thy tempest , and make them afraid with thy storm . 83 : 16 Fill their faces with shame ; that they may seek thy name , O LORD . 83 : 17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever ; yea , let them be put to shame , and perish : 83	l
11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways . 91 : 12 They shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone . 91 : 13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet . 91 : 14 Because he hath set his love upon me , therefore will I deliver him : I will set him on high , because he hath known my name . 91 : 15 He shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him . 91 : 16 With long life will I satisfy him , and shew him my salvation . 92 : 1 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD , AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME , O MOST HIGH : 92 : 2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning , and thy faithfulness every night , 92 : 3 Upon an instrument of ten strings ,	l
Thy testimonies are very sure : holiness becometh thine house , O LORD , for ever . 94 : 1 O Lord God , to whom vengeance belongeth ; O God , to whom vengeance belongeth , shew thyself . 94 : 2 Lift up thyself , thou judge of the earth : render a reward to the proud . 94 : 3 LORD , how long shall the wicked , how long shall the wicked triumph ? 94 : 4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things ? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves ? 94 : 5 They break in pieces thy people , O LORD , and afflict thine heritage . 94 : 6 They slay the widow and the stranger , and murder the fatherless . 94 : 7 Yet they say , The LORD shall not see , neither shall the God of Jacob regard it . 94 : 8 Understand , ye brutish among the people : and ye fools , when will ye be wise ? 94 : 9 He that planted the ear , shall he not hear ? he that formed the eye , shall he not	l
see ? 94 : 10 He that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ? he that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ? 94 : 11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man , that they are vanity . 94 : 12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest , O LORD , and teachest him out of thy law ; 94 : 13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit be digged for the wicked . 94 : 14 For the LORD will not cast off his	s
people , neither will he forsake his inheritance . 94 : 15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness : and all the upright in heart shall follow it . 94 : 16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers ? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity ? 94 : 17 Unless the LORD had been my help , my soul had almost dwelt in silence . 94 : 18 When I said , My foot slippeth ; thy mercy , O LORD , held me up . 94 : 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul . 94 : 20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee , which frameth mischief by a law ? 94 : 21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood . 94 : 22 But the LORD is my defence ; and my God is the rock of my refuge . 94 : 23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity , and shall cut them off in their own wickedness ; yea , the LORD our	l
the people , give unto the LORD glory and strength . 96 : 8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come into his courts . 96 : 9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness : fear before him , all the earth . 96 : 10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth : the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved : he shall judge the people righteously . 96 : 11 Let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof . 96 : 12 Let the field be joyful , and all that is therein : then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 96 : 13 Before the LORD : for he cometh , for he cometh to judge the earth : he shall judge the world with righteousness , and the people with his truth . 97 : 1 The LORD reigneth ; let the earth rejoice ; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof . 97 : 2 Clouds and darkness are round	l
thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein . 98 : 8 Let the floods clap their hands : let the hills be joyful together 98 : 9 Before the LORD ; for he cometh to judge the earth : with righteousness shall he judge the world , and the people with equity . 99 : 1 The LORD reigneth ; let the people tremble : he sitteth between the cherubims ; let the earth be moved . 99 : 2 The LORD is great in Zion ; and he is high above all the people . 99 : 3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name ; for it is holy . 99 : 4 The king ' s strength also loveth judgment ; thou dost establish equity , thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob . 99 : 5 Exalt ye the LORD our God , and worship at his footstool ; for he is holy . 99 : 6 Moses and Aaron among his priests , and Samuel among them that call upon his name ; they called upon the LORD , and he answered them . 99 : 7 He spake unto them	l
in the cloudy pillar : they kept his testimonies , and the ordinance that he gave them . 99 : 8 Thou answeredst them , O LORD our God : thou wast a God that forgavest them , though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions . 99 : 9 Exalt the LORD our God , and worship at his holy hill ; for the LORD our God is holy . 100 : 1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD , all ye lands . 100 : 2 Serve the LORD with gladness : come before his presence with singing	s
10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lifted me up , and cast me down . 102 : 11 My days are like a shadow that declineth ; and I am withered like grass . 102 : 12 But thou , O LORD , shall endure for ever ; and thy remembrance unto all generations . 102 : 13 Thou shalt arise , and have mercy upon Zion : for the time to favour her , yea , the set time , is come . 102 : 14 For thy servants take pleasure in her	s
stones , and favour the dust thereof . 102 : 15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD , and all the kings of the earth thy glory . 102 : 16 When the LORD shall build up Zion , he shall appear in his glory . 102 : 17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute , and not despise their prayer . 102 : 18 This shall be written for the generation to come : and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD . 102 : 19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary ; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth ; 102 : 20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner ; to loose those that are appointed to death ; 102 : 21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion , and his praise in Jerusalem ; 102 : 22 When the people are gathered together , and the kingdoms , to serve the LORD . 102 : 23 He weakened my strength in the way ; he shortened my days . 102 : 24 I said , O my God	l
are as grass : as a flower of the field , so he flourisheth . 103 : 16 For the wind passeth over it , and it is gone ; and the place thereof shall know it no more . 103 : 17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him , and his righteousness unto children ' s children ; 103 : 18 To such as keep his covenant , and to those that remember his commandments to do them . 103 : 19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens ; and his kingdom ruleth over all . 103 : 20 Bless the LORD , ye his angels , that excel in strength , that do his commandments , hearkening unto the voice of his word . 103 : 21 Bless ye the LORD , all ye his hosts ; ye ministers of his , that do his pleasure . 103 : 22 Bless the LORD , all his works in all places of his dominion : bless the LORD , O my soul . 104 : 1 Bless the LORD , O my soul . O LORD	l
the conies . 104 : 19 He appointed the moon for seasons : the sun knoweth his going down . 104 : 20 Thou makest darkness , and it is night : wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth . 104 : 21 The young lions roar after their prey , and seek their meat from God . 104 : 22 The sun ariseth , they gather themselves together , and lay them down in their dens . 104 : 23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening . 104 : 24 O LORD , how manifold are thy works ! in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches . 104 : 25 So is this great and wide sea , wherein are things creeping innumerable , both small and great beasts . 104 : 26 There go the ships : there is that leviathan , whom thou hast made to play therein . 104 : 27 These wait all upon thee ; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season . 104 : 28 That thou givest them they gather :	l
thou openest thine hand , they are filled with good . 104 : 29 Thou hidest thy face , they are troubled : thou takest away their breath , they die , and return to their dust . 104 : 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit , they are created : and thou renewest the face of the earth . 104 : 31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever : the LORD shall rejoice in his works . 104 : 32 He looketh on the earth , and it trembleth : he toucheth the hills , and	s
of Jacob his chosen . 105 : 7 He is the LORD our God : his judgments are in all the earth . 105 : 8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations . 105 : 9 Which covenant he made with Abraham , and his oath unto Isaac ; 105 : 10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant : 105 : 11 Saying , Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan , the lot of your	s
goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men ! 107 : 16 For he hath broken the gates of brass , and cut the bars of iron in sunder . 107 : 17 Fools because of their transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted . 107 : 18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat ; and they draw near unto the gates of death . 107 : 19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble , and he saveth them out of their distresses . 107 : 20 He sent	s
thy glory above all the earth ; 108 : 6 That thy beloved may be delivered : save with thy right hand , and answer me . 108 : 7 God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth . 108 : 8 Gilead is mine ; Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ; 108 : 9 Moab is my washpot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe ; over Philistia will I triumph . 108 : 10 Who will bring me into the strong city ? who will lead me into Edom ? 108 : 11 Wilt not thou , O God , who hast cast us off ? and wilt not thou , O God , go forth with our hosts ? 108 : 12 Give us help from trouble : for vain is the help of man . 108 : 13 Through God we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies . 109 : 1 Hold not thy peace , O God of	l
: and let Satan stand at his right hand . 109 : 7 When he shall be judged , let him be condemned : and let his prayer become sin . 109 : 8 Let his days be few ; and let another take his office . 109 : 9 Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow . 109 : 10 Let his children be continually vagabonds , and beg : let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places . 109 : 11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath ; and let the strangers spoil his labour . 109 : 12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him : neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children . 109 : 13 Let his posterity be cut off ; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out . 109 : 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD ; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out . 109 : 15 Let them be before the LORD continually , that he may cut off the memory of them	l
princes of his people . 113 : 9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house , and to be a joyful mother of children . Praise ye the LORD . 114 : 1 When Israel went out of Egypt , the house of Jacob from a people of strange language ; 114 : 2 Judah was his sanctuary , and Israel his dominion . 114 : 3 The sea saw it , and fled : Jordan was driven back . 114 : 4 The mountains skipped like rams , and the little hills like lambs . 114 : 5	s
shield . 115 : 11 Ye that fear the LORD , trust in the LORD : he is their help and their shield . 115 : 12 The LORD hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel ; he will bless the house of Aaron . 115 : 13 He will bless them that fear the LORD , both small and great . 115 : 14 The LORD shall increase you more and more , you and your children . 115 : 15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth . 115 : 16 The heaven , even the heavens , are the LORD ' s : but the earth hath he given to the children of men . 115 : 17 The dead praise not the LORD , neither any that go down into silence . 115 : 18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore . Praise the LORD . 116 : 1 I love the LORD , because he hath heard my voice and my supplications . 116 : 2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto	l
. 116 : 7 Return unto thy rest , O my soul ; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee . 116 : 8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death , mine eyes from tears , and my feet from falling . 116 : 9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living . 116 : 10 I believed , therefore have I spoken : I was greatly afflicted : 116 : 11 I said in my haste , All men are liars . 116 : 12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me ? 116 : 13 I will take the cup of salvation , and call upon the name of the LORD . 116 : 14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people . 116 : 15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints . 116 : 16 O LORD , truly I am thy servant ; I am thy servant , and the son of thine handmaid : thou hast loosed my bonds . 116 : 17 I will	l
and song , and is become my salvation . 118 : 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous : the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly . 118 : 16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted : the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly . 118 : 17 I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the LORD . 118 : 18 The LORD hath chastened me sore : but he hath not given me over unto death . 118 : 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness : I will go into them , and I will praise the LORD : 118 : 20 This gate of the LORD , into which the righteous shall enter . 118 : 21 I will praise thee : for thou hast heard me , and art become my salvation . 118 : 22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner . 118 : 23 This is the LORD ' s doing ; it is marvellous in our eyes . 118 : 24 This is the day which the	l
respect unto thy ways . 119 : 16 I will delight myself in thy statutes : I will not forget thy word . 119 : 17 Deal bountifully with thy servant , that I may live , and keep thy word . 119 : 18 Open thou mine eyes , that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law . 119 : 19 I am a stranger in the earth : hide not thy commandments from me . 119 : 20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times . 119 : 21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed , which do err from thy commandments . 119 : 22 Remove from me reproach and contempt ; for I have kept thy testimonies . 119 : 23 Princes also did sit and speak against me : but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes . 119 : 24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors . leth . 119 : 25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust : quicken thou me according to thy word . 119 : 26 I have declared my ways , and thou heardest	l
shame . 119 : 32 I will run the way of thy commandments , when thou shalt enlarge my heart . 119 : 33 Teach me , O LORD , the way of thy statutes ; and I shall keep it unto the end . 119 : 34 Give me understanding , and I shall keep thy law ; yea , I shall observe it with my whole heart . 119 : 35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments ; for therein do I delight . 119 : 36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies , and not to covetousness . 119 : 37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity ; and quicken thou me in thy way . 119 : 38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant , who is devoted to thy fear . 119 : 39 Turn away my reproach which I fear : for thy judgments are good . 119 : 40 Behold , I have longed after thy precepts : quicken me in thy righteousness . 119 : 41 Let thy mercies come also unto me , O LORD , even thy salvation , according to thy word . 119	l
will delight myself in thy commandments , which I have loved . 119 : 48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments , which I have loved ; and I will meditate in thy statutes . 119 : 49 Remember the word unto thy servant , upon which thou hast caused me to hope . 119 : 50 This is my comfort in my affliction : for thy word hath quickened me . 119 : 51 The proud have had me greatly in derision : yet have I not declined from thy law . 119 : 52 I remembered thy judgments of old , O LORD ; and have comforted myself . 119 : 53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law . 119 : 54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage . 119 : 55 I have remembered thy name , O LORD , in the night , and have kept thy law . 119 : 56 This I had , because I kept thy precepts . 119 : 57 Thou art my portion , O LORD : I have said that I	l
; but I forsook not thy precepts . 119 : 88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness ; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth . 119 : 89 For ever , O LORD , thy word is settled in heaven . 119 : 90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations : thou hast established the earth , and it abideth . 119 : 91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances : for all are thy servants . 119 : 92 Unless thy law had been my delights , I should then have perished in mine affliction	s
, O LORD , and teach me thy judgments . 119 : 109 My soul is continually in my hand : yet do I not forget thy law . 119 : 110 The wicked have laid a snare for me : yet I erred not from thy precepts . 119 : 111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever : for they are the rejoicing of my heart . 119 : 112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway , even unto the end . 119 : 113 I hate vain thoughts : but thy law do I love . 119 : 114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield : I hope in thy word . 119 : 115 Depart from me , ye evildoers : for I will keep the commandments of my God . 119 : 116 Uphold me according unto thy word , that I may live : and let me not be ashamed of my hope . 119 : 117 Hold thou me up , and I shall be safe : and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually . 119 : 118 Thou hast trodden down	l
their hands unto iniquity . 125 : 4 Do good , O LORD , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts . 125 : 5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon Israel . 126 : 1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion , we were like them that dream . 126 : 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing : then said they among the heathen , The LORD hath done great things for them . 126 : 3 The LORD hath done great things for us ; whereof we are glad . 126 : 4 Turn again our captivity , O LORD , as the streams in the south . 126 : 5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy . 126 : 6 He that goeth forth and weepeth , bearing precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him . 127 : 1 Except the LORD build the house	l
yet they have not prevailed against me . 129 : 3 The plowers plowed upon my back : they made long their furrows . 129 : 4 The LORD is righteous : he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked . 129 : 5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion . 129 : 6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops , which withereth afore it groweth up : 129 : 7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand ; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom . 129 : 8 Neither	s
and my testimony that I shall teach them , their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore . 132 : 13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion ; he hath desired it for his habitation . 132 : 14 This is my rest for ever : here will I dwell ; for I have desired it . 132 : 15 I will abundantly bless her provision : I will satisfy her poor with bread . 132 : 16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation : and her saints shall shout aloud for joy . 132 :	s
17 There will I make the horn of David to bud : I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed . 132 : 18 His enemies will I clothe with shame : but upon himself shall his crown flourish . 133 : 1 Behold , how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity ! 133 : 2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron ' s beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ; 133 : 3 As the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the LORD commanded the blessing , even life for evermore . 134 : 1 Behold , bless ye the LORD , all ye servants of the LORD , which by night stand in the house of the LORD . 134 : 2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary , and bless the LORD . 134 : 3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion . 135 : 1 Praise ye the LORD . Praise ye	l
the name of the LORD ; praise him , O ye servants of the LORD . 135 : 2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD , in the courts of the house of our God . 135 : 3 Praise the LORD ; for the LORD is good : sing praises unto his name ; for it is pleasant . 135 : 4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself , and Israel for his peculiar treasure . 135 : 5 For I know that the LORD is great , and that our Lord is above	s
25 Who giveth food to all flesh : for his mercy endureth for ever . 136 : 26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven : for his mercy endureth for ever . 137 : 1 By the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered Zion . 137 : 2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof . 137 : 3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth ,	s
thy truth : for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name . 138 : 3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me , and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul . 138 : 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee , O LORD , when they hear the words of thy mouth . 138 : 5 Yea , they shall sing in the ways of the LORD : for great is the glory of the LORD . 138 : 6 Though the LORD be high , yet hath he respect unto the	s
awake , I am still with thee . 139 : 19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked , O God : depart from me therefore , ye bloody men . 139 : 20 For they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain . 139 : 21 Do not I hate them , O LORD , that hate thee ? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ? 139 : 22 I hate them with perfect hatred : I count them mine enemies . 139 : 23 Search me ,	s
, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle . 140 : 8 Grant not , O LORD , the desires of the wicked : further not his wicked device ; lest they exalt themselves . Selah . 140 : 9 As for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them . 140 : 10 Let burning coals fall upon them : let them be cast into the fire ; into deep pits , that they rise not up again . 140 : 11 Let not an evil	s
: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities . 141 : 6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places , they shall hear my words ; for they are sweet . 141 : 7 Our bones are scattered at the grave ' s mouth , as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth . 141 : 8 But mine eyes are unto thee , O GOD the Lord : in thee is my trust ; leave not my soul destitute . 141 : 9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for	s
the God of Jacob for his help , whose hope is in the LORD his God : 146 : 6 Which made heaven , and earth , the sea , and all that therein is : which keepeth truth for ever : 146 : 7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed : which giveth food to the hungry . The LORD looseth the prisoners : 146 : 8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind : the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down : the LORD loveth the righteous : 146 : 9 The LORD preserveth the strangers ; he relieveth the fatherless and widow : but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down . 146 : 10 The LORD shall reign for ever , even thy God , O Zion , unto all generations . Praise ye the LORD . 147 : 1 Praise ye the LORD : for it is good to sing praises unto our God ; for it is pleasant ; and praise is comely . 147 : 2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem : he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel . 147 : 3 He healeth the broken in	l
I will mock when your fear cometh ; 1 : 27 When your fear cometh as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you . 1 : 28 Then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me : 1 : 29 For that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the LORD : 1 : 30 They would none of my counsel : they despised all my reproof . 1 :	s
ways acknowledge him , and he shall direct thy paths . 3 : 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes : fear the LORD , and depart from evil . 3 : 8 It shall be health to thy navel , and marrow to thy bones . 3 : 9 Honour the LORD with thy substance , and with the firstfruits of all thine increase : 3 : 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty , and thy presses shall burst out with new wine . 3 : 11 My son , despise not the chastening of the LORD ; neither be weary of his correction : 3 : 12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth . 3 : 13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding . 3 : 14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver , and the gain thereof than fine gold . 3 : 15 She is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her . 3	l
3 : 35 The wise shall inherit glory : but shame shall be the promotion of fools . 4 : 1 Hear , ye children , the instruction of a father , and attend to know understanding . 4 : 2 For I give you good doctrine , forsake ye not my law . 4 : 3 For I was my father ' s son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother . 4 : 4 He taught me also , and said unto me , Let thine heart retain my words : keep my commandments , and live . 4 : 5 Get wisdom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth . 4 : 6 Forsake her not , and she shall preserve thee : love her , and she shall keep thee . 4 : 7 Wisdom is the principal thing ; therefore get wisdom : and with all thy getting get understanding . 4 : 8 Exalt her , and she shall promote thee : she shall bring thee to honour , when thou dost embrace her . 4 : 9 She shall give	l
2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth , thou art taken with the words of thy mouth . 6 : 3 Do this now , my son , and deliver thyself , when thou art come into the hand of thy friend ; go , humble thyself , and make sure thy friend . 6 : 4 Give not sleep to thine eyes , nor slumber to thine eyelids . 6 : 5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler . 6	s
if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ; 6 : 31 But if he be found , he shall restore sevenfold ; he shall give all the substance of his house . 6 : 32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding : he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul . 6 : 33 A wound and dishonour shall he get ; and his reproach shall not be wiped away . 6 : 34 For jealousy is the rage of a man : therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance	s
. 6 : 35 He will not regard any ransom ; neither will he rest content , though thou givest many gifts . 7 : 1 My son , keep my words , and lay up my commandments with thee . 7 : 2 Keep my commandments , and live ; and my law as the apple of thine eye . 7 : 3 Bind them upon thy fingers , write them upon the table of thine heart . 7 : 4 Say unto wisdom , Thou art my sister ; and call understanding thy kinswoman : 7 : 5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman , from the stranger which flattereth with her words . 7 : 6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement , 7 : 7 And beheld among the simple ones , I discerned among the youths , a young man void of understanding , 7 : 8 Passing through the street near her corner ; and he went the way to her house , 7 : 9 In the twilight , in the evening , in the black and dark night : 7 : 10 And	l
forth : 8 : 26 While as yet he had not made the earth , nor the fields , nor the highest part of the dust of the world . 8 : 27 When he prepared the heavens , I was there : when he set a compass upon the face of the depth : 8 : 28 When he established the clouds above : when he strengthened the fountains of the deep : 8 : 29 When he gave to the sea his decree , that the waters should not pass his commandment : when he appointed the foundations	s
the righteous to famish : but he casteth away the substance of the wicked . 10 : 4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand : but the hand of the diligent maketh rich . 10 : 5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son : but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame . 10 : 6 Blessings are upon the head of the just : but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked . 10 : 7 The memory of the just is blessed : but the name of the wicked shall rot . 10 : 8 The wise in heart will receive commandments : but a prating fool shall fall . 10 : 9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely : but he that perverteth his ways shall be known . 10 : 10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow : but a prating fool shall fall . 10 : 11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life : but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked . 10 : 12 Hatred stirreth up strifes : but love covereth all sins . 10	l
: 31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom : but the froward tongue shall be cut out . 10 : 32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable : but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness . 11 : 1 A false balance is abomination to the LORD : but a just weight is his delight . 11 : 2 When pride cometh , then cometh shame : but with the lowly is wisdom . 11 : 3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them : but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them . 11 : 4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath : but righteousness delivereth from death . 11 : 5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way : but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness . 11 : 6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them : but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness . 11 : 7 When a wicked man dieth , his expectation shall perish : and the hope of unjust men perisheth . 11 : 8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble , and the wicked	l
: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised . 12 : 9 He that is despised , and hath a servant , is better than he that honoureth himself , and lacketh bread . 12 : 10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast : but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel . 12 : 11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding . 12 : 12 The wicked desireth the net of evil men : but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit . 12 : 13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips : but the just shall come out of trouble . 12 : 14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth : and the recompence of a man ' s hands shall be rendered unto him . 12 : 15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes : but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise . 12 : 16 A fool ' s wrath is presently known : but a	l
will utter lies . 14 : 6 A scorner seeketh wisdom , and findeth it not : but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth . 14 : 7 Go from the presence of a foolish man , when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge . 14 : 8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way : but the folly of fools is deceit . 14 : 9 Fools make a mock at sin : but among the righteous there is favour . 14 : 10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness ; and	s
a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy . 14 : 11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown : but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish . 14 : 12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man , but the end thereof are the ways of death . 14 : 13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful ; and the end of that mirth is heaviness . 14 : 14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself . 14 : 15 The simple believeth every word : but the prudent man looketh well to his going . 14 : 16 A wise man feareth , and departeth from evil : but the fool rageth , and is confident . 14 : 17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly : and a man of wicked devices is hated . 14 : 18 The simple inherit folly : but the prudent are crowned with knowledge . 14 : 19 The evil bow before the good ; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous . 14 : 20 The	l
poor is hated even of his own neighbour : but the rich hath many friends . 14 : 21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth : but he that hath mercy on the poor , happy is he . 14 : 22 Do they not err that devise evil ? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good . 14 : 23 In all labour there is profit : but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury . 14 : 24 The crown of the wise is their riches : but the foolishness of fools	s
he go unto the wise . 15 : 13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance : but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken . 15 : 14 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge : but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness . 15 : 15 All the days of the afflicted are evil : but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast . 15 : 16 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith . 15 : 17 Better is a	s
that keepeth understanding shall find good . 19 : 9 A false witness shall not be unpunished , and he that speaketh lies shall perish . 19 : 10 Delight is not seemly for a fool ; much less for a servant to have rule over princes . 19 : 11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger ; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression . 19 : 12 The king ' s wrath is as the roaring of a lion ; but his favour is as dew upon the grass . 19 : 13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father : and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping . 19 : 14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers : and a prudent wife is from the LORD . 19 : 15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep ; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger . 19 : 16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul ; but he that despiseth his ways shall die . 19 : 17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD ; and that which	l
whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise . 20 : 2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion : whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul . 20 : 3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife : but every fool will be meddling . 20 : 4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold ; therefore shall he beg in harvest , and have nothing . 20 : 5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of	s
21 : 3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice . 21 : 4 An high look , and a proud heart , and the plowing of the wicked , is sin . 21 : 5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness ; but of every one that is hasty only to want . 21 : 6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death . 21 : 7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them ; because they refuse to do judgment . 21 : 8 The way of man is froward and strange : but as for the pure , his work is right . 21 : 9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman in a wide house . 21 : 10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil : his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes . 21 : 11 When the scorner is punished , the simple is made wise : and when the wise is instructed , he receiveth knowledge .	l
the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead . 21 : 17 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man : he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich . 21 : 18 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous , and the transgressor for the upright . 21 : 19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness , than with a contentious and an angry woman . 21 : 20 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise ; but a foolish man spendeth it up . 21 : 21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life , righteousness , and honour . 21 : 22 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty , and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof . 21 : 23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles . 21 : 24 Proud and haughty scorner is his name , who dealeth in proud wrath . 21 : 25 The desire of the slothful killeth him ; for his hands refuse to labour . 21 : 26 He	l
: 22 Rob not the poor , because he is poor : neither oppress the afflicted in the gate : 22 : 23 For the LORD will plead their cause , and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them . 22 : 24 Make no friendship with an angry man ; and with a furious man thou shalt not go : 22 : 25 Lest thou learn his ways , and get a snare to thy soul . 22 : 26 Be not thou one of them that strike hands , or of them that are sureties for debts	s
thy father that begat thee , and despise not thy mother when she is old . 23 : 23 Buy the truth , and sell it not ; also wisdom , and instruction , and understanding . 23 : 24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice : and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him . 23 : 25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad , and she that bare thee shall rejoice . 23 : 26 My son , give me thine heart , and let thine eyes observe my ways	s
thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth : 24 : 18 Lest the LORD see it , and it displease him , and he turn away his wrath from him . 24 : 19 Fret not thyself because of evil men , neither be thou envious at the wicked : 24 : 20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man ; the candle of the wicked shall be put out . 24 : 21 My son , fear thou the LORD and the king : and meddle not with them that are given to change : 24 : 22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly ; and who knoweth the ruin of them both ? 24 : 23 These things also belong to the wise . It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment . 24 : 24 He that saith unto the wicked , Thou are righteous ; him shall the people curse , nations shall abhor him : 24 : 25 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight , and a good blessing shall come upon them . 24 : 26 Every man	l
: 2 As the bird by wandering , as the swallow by flying , so the curse causeless shall not come . 26 : 3 A whip for the horse , a bridle for the ass , and a rod for the fool ' s back . 26 : 4 Answer not a fool according to his folly , lest thou also be like unto him . 26 : 5 Answer a fool according to his folly , lest he be wise in his own conceit . 26 : 6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a	s
shall be honoured . 27 : 19 As in water face answereth to face , so the heart of man to man . 27 : 20 Hell and destruction are never full ; so the eyes of man are never satisfied . 27 : 21 As the fining pot for silver , and the furnace for gold ; so is a man to his praise . 27 : 22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle , yet will not his foolishness depart from him . 27 : 23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks , and look well to thy herds . 27 : 24 For riches are not for ever : and doth the crown endure to every generation ? 27 : 25 The hay appeareth , and the tender grass sheweth itself , and herbs of the mountains are gathered . 27 : 26 The lambs are for thy clothing , and the goats are the price of the field . 27 : 27 And thou shalt have goats ' milk enough for thy food , for the food of thy household , and for the	l
any person shall flee to the pit ; let no man stay him . 28 : 18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved : but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once . 28 : 19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough . 28 : 20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings : but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent . 28 : 21 To have respect of persons is not good : for for a piece of bread that man will transgress . 28 : 22 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him . 28 : 23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue . 28 : 24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , It is no transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer . 28 : 25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife : but he that	l
and take the name of my God in vain . 30 : 10 Accuse not a servant unto his master , lest he curse thee , and thou be found guilty . 30 : 11 There is a generation that curseth their father , and doth not bless their mother . 30 : 12 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes , and yet is not washed from their filthiness . 30 : 13 There is a generation , O how lofty are their eyes ! and their eyelids are lifted up . 30 : 14	s
. 30 : 20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman ; she eateth , and wipeth her mouth , and saith , I have done no wickedness . 30 : 21 For three things the earth is disquieted , and for four which it cannot bear : 30 : 22 For a servant when he reigneth ; and a fool when he is filled with meat ; 30 : 23 For an odious woman when she is married ; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress . 30 : 24 There be four things which are	s
little upon the earth , but they are exceeding wise : 30 : 25 The ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ; 30 : 26 The conies are but a feeble folk , yet make they their houses in the rocks ; 30 : 27 The locusts have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ; 30 : 28 The spider taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings ' palaces . 30 : 29 There be three things which go well , yea , four are comely in going : 30 : 30 A lion which is strongest among beasts , and turneth not away for any ; 30 : 31 A greyhound ; an he goat also ; and a king , against whom there is no rising up . 30 : 32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself , or if thou hast thought evil , lay thine hand upon thy mouth . 30 : 33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter , and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood : so the forcing	l
She stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy . 31 : 21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household : for all her household are clothed with scarlet . 31 : 22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry ; her clothing is silk and purple . 31 : 23 Her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land . 31 : 24 She maketh fine linen , and selleth it ; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant . 31 : 25 Strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come . 31 : 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness . 31 : 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness . 31 : 28 Her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her . 31 : 29 Many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all . 31 : 30	l
seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit . 1 : 15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight : and that which is wanting cannot be numbered . 1 : 16 I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge . 1 : 17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly : I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit . 1 : 18 For in much wisdom is much grief : and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow . 2 : 1 I said in mine heart , Go to now , I will prove thee with mirth , therefore enjoy pleasure : and , behold , this also is vanity . 2 : 2 I said of laughter , It is mad : and of mirth , What doeth it ? 2 : 3 I sought in	l
works ; for that is his portion : for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him ? 4 : 1 So I returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter . 4 : 2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive . 4 : 3 Yea , better	s
is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun . 4 : 4 Again , I considered all travail , and every right work , that for this a man is envied of his neighbour . This is also vanity and vexation of spirit . 4 : 5 The fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh . 4 : 6 Better is an handful with quietness , than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit . 4 : 7 Then I returned , and I saw vanity under the sun . 4 : 8 There is one alone , and there is not a second ; yea , he hath neither child nor brother : yet is there no end of all his labour ; neither is his eye satisfied with riches ; neither saith he , For whom do I labour , and bereave my soul of good ? This is also vanity , yea , it is a sore travail . 4 : 9 Two are better than one ; because they have a good	l
all points as he came , so shall he go : and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind ? 5 : 17 All his days also he eateth in darkness , and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness . 5 : 18 Behold that which I have seen : it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink , and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life , which God giveth him : for it is his portion . 5 : 19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth , and hath given him power to eat thereof , and to take his portion , and to rejoice in his labour ; this is the gift of God . 5 : 20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life ; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart . 6 : 1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun , and it is common among men : 6 : 2 A man to	l
whom God hath given riches , wealth , and honour , so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth , yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof , but a stranger eateth it : this is vanity , and it is an evil disease . 6 : 3 If a man beget an hundred children , and live many years , so that the days of his years be many , and his soul be not filled with good , and also that he have no burial ; I say , that an	s
for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart . 7 : 3 Sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better . 7 : 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth . 7 : 5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools . 7 : 6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity . 7 : 7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad ; and a gift destroyeth the heart . 7 : 8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof : and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit . 7 : 9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry : for anger resteth in the bosom of fools . 7 : 10 Say not thou , What is the cause that the	l
, therefore the misery of man is great upon him . 8 : 7 For he knoweth not that which shall be : for who can tell him when it shall be ? 8 : 8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it . 8 : 9 All this have I seen , and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun : there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt . 8 : 10 And so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity . 8 : 11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil . 8 : 12 Though a sinner do evil an	l
hundred times , and his days be prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , which fear before him : 8 : 13 But it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before God . 8 : 14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth ; that there be just men , unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked ; again , there be wicked men	s
, by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please . 3 : 6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all powders of the merchant ? 3 : 7 Behold his bed , which is Solomon ' s ; threescore valiant men are about it , of the valiant of Israel . 3 : 8 They all hold swords , being expert in war : every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night . 3 : 9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon . 3 : 10 He made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem . 3 : 11 Go forth , O ye daughters of Zion , and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals , and in the day	l
the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus . 7 : 5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel , and the hair of thine head like purple ; the king is held in the galleries . 7 : 6 How fair and how pleasant art thou , O love , for delights ! 7 : 7 This thy stature is like to a palm tree , and thy breasts to clusters of grapes . 7 : 8 I said , I will go up to the palm tree , I will take hold of the boughs thereof : now	s
evil ; 1 : 17 Learn to do well ; seek judgment , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow . 1 : 18 Come now , and let us reason together , saith the LORD : though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool . 1 : 19 If ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land : 1 : 20 But if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword : for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it . 1 : 21 How is the faithful city become an harlot ! it was full of judgment ; righteousness lodged in it ; but now murderers . 1 : 22 Thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water : 1 : 23 Thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them . 1	l
all the hills that are lifted up , 2 : 15 And upon every high tower , and upon every fenced wall , 2 : 16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish , and upon all pleasant pictures . 2 : 17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day . 2 : 18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish . 2 : 19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the LORD , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth . 2 : 20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ; 2 : 21 To go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the tops of the ragged rocks , for fear of the LORD , and for the glory	l
glory . 3 : 9 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them ; and they declare their sin as Sodom , they hide it not . Woe unto their soul ! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves . 3 : 10 Say ye to the righteous , that it shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their doings . 3 : 11 Woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his hands shall be given him . 3 : 12 As for my	s
people , and he hath stretched forth his hand against them , and hath smitten them : and the hills did tremble , and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets . For all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still . 5 : 26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly : 5 : 27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken : 5 : 28 Whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent , their horses ' hoofs shall be counted like flint , and their wheels like a whirlwind : 5 : 29 Their roaring shall be like a lion , they shall roar like young lions : yea , they shall roar , and lay hold of the prey , and shall carry it away safe , and none	l
and convert , and be healed . 6 : 11 Then said I , Lord , how long ? And he answered , Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant , and the houses without man , and the land be utterly desolate , 6 : 12 And the LORD have removed men far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land . 6 : 13 But yet in it shall be a tenth , and it shall return , and shall be eaten : as a teil tree , and as an oak , whose substance is in them , when they cast their leaves : so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof . 7 : 1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it . 7 : 2 And it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is	l
confederate with Ephraim . And his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind . 7 : 3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah , Go forth now to meet Ahaz , thou , and Shearjashub thy son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller ' s field ; 7 : 4 And say unto him , Take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these	s
; ask it either in the depth , or in the height above . 7 : 12 But Ahaz said , I will not ask , neither will I tempt the LORD . 7 : 13 And he said , Hear ye now , O house of David ; Is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will ye weary my God also ? 7 : 14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign ; Behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Immanuel .	s
7 : 15 Butter and honey shall he eat , that he may know to refuse the evil , and choose the good . 7 : 16 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings . 7 : 17 The LORD shall bring upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon thy father ' s house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria . 7 : 18 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria . 7 : 19 And they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes . 7 : 20 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired ,	l
glory : and he shall come up over all his channels , and go over all his banks : 8 : 8 And he shall pass through Judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Immanuel . 8 : 9 Associate yourselves , O ye people , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; and give ear , all ye of far countries : gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces . 8 : 10 Take counsel together , and it shall come to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us . 8 : 11 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying , 8 : 12 Say ye not , A confederacy , to all them to whom this people shall say , A confederacy ; neither fear ye	l
: 16 Bind up the testimony , seal the law among my disciples . 8 : 17 And I will wait upon the LORD , that hideth his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him . 8 : 18 Behold , I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion . 8 : 19 And when they shall say unto you , Seek unto them that have familiar spirits , and unto wizards that peep , and that mutter : should not a people seek unto their God ? for the living to the dead ? 8 : 20 To the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them . 8 : 21 And they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and look upward . 8 :	l
to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever . The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this . 9 : 8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob , and it hath lighted upon Israel . 9 : 9 And all the people shall know , even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria , that say in the pride and stoutness of heart , 9 : 10 The bricks are fallen down , but we will build with hewn stones : the sycomores are cut down , but we will change them into	s
all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still . 9 : 18 For wickedness burneth as the fire : it shall devour the briers and thorns , and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke . 9 : 19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire : no man shall spare his brother . 9 : 20 And he shall snatch on	s
truth . 10 : 21 The remnant shall return , even the remnant of Jacob , unto the mighty God . 10 : 22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea , yet a remnant of them shall return : the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness . 10 : 23 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption , even determined , in the midst of all the land . 10 : 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts , O my people that dwellest in Zion , be not	s
and the haughty shall be humbled . 10 : 34 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron , and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one . 11 : 1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse , and a Branch shall grow out of his roots : 11 : 2 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD ; 11 : 3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing of his ears : 11 : 4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor , and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth : and he shall smite the earth : with the rod of his mouth , and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked . 11 : 5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins ,	l
shall put his hand on the cockatrice ' den . 11 : 9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD , as the waters cover the sea . 11 : 10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse , which shall stand for an ensign of the people ; to it shall the Gentiles seek : and his rest shall be glorious . 11 : 11 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people , which shall be left , from Assyria , and from Egypt , and from Pathros , and from Cush , and from Elam , and from Shinar , and from Hamath , and from the islands of the sea . 11 : 12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth . 11 : 13 The envy also of	l
river , and shall smite it in the seven streams , and make men go over dryshod . 11 : 16 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people , which shall be left , from Assyria ; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt . 12 : 1 And in that day thou shalt say , O LORD , I will praise thee : though thou wast angry with me , thine anger is turned away , and thou comfortedst me . 12 : 2 Behold , God is my salvation ; I will trust , and not be afraid : for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song ; he also is become my salvation . 12 : 3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation . 12 : 4 And in that day shall ye say , Praise the LORD , call upon his name , declare his doings among the people , make mention that his name is exalted . 12 : 5 Sing unto the LORD ; for he hath done	l
17 That made the world as a wilderness , and destroyed the cities thereof ; that opened not the house of his prisoners ? 14 : 18 All the kings of the nations , even all of them , lie in glory , every one in his own house . 14 : 19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch , and as the raiment of those that are slain , thrust through with a sword , that go down to the stones of the pit ; as a carcase trodden under feet . 14 : 20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial , because thou hast destroyed thy land , and slain thy people : the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned . 14 : 21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities . 14 : 22 For I will rise up against them , saith the LORD of hosts , and cut off from Babylon the name , and remnant , and son ,	l
from the north a smoke , and none shall be alone in his appointed times . 14 : 32 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation ? That the LORD hath founded Zion , and the poor of his people shall trust in it . 15 : 1 The burden of Moab . Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; 15 : 2 He is gone up to Bajith , and to	s
thee with my tears , O Heshbon , and Elealeh : for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen . 16 : 10 And gladness is taken away , and joy out of the plentiful field ; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing , neither shall there be shouting : the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses ; I have made their vintage shouting to cease . 16 : 11 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab , and mine inward parts for Kirharesh . 16 : 12 And it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail . 16 : 13 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time . 16 : 14 But now the LORD hath spoken , saying , Within three years , as the years of an hireling , and the glory of Moab shall be contemned , with all that great multitude ; and the remnant shall be very	l
fear unto me . 21 : 5 Prepare the table , watch in the watchtower , eat , drink : arise , ye princes , and anoint the shield . 21 : 6 For thus hath the LORD said unto me , Go , set a watchman , let him declare what he seeth . 21 : 7 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen , a chariot of asses , and a chariot of camels ; and he hearkened diligently with much heed : 21 : 8 And he cried , A lion : My lord	s
him that was thirsty , they prevented with their bread him that fled . 21 : 15 For they fled from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war . 21 : 16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me , Within a year , according to the years of an hireling , and all the glory of Kedar shall fail : 21 : 17 And the residue of the number of archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , shall be diminished :	s
And it shall be , as with the people , so with the priest ; as with the servant , so with his master ; as with the maid , so with her mistress ; as with the buyer , so with the seller ; as with the lender , so with the borrower ; as with the taker of usury , so with the giver of usury to him . 24 : 3 The land shall be utterly emptied , and utterly spoiled : for the LORD hath spoken this word . 24 : 4 The earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish . 24 : 5 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws , changed the ordinance , broken the everlasting covenant . 24 : 6 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth , and they that dwell therein are desolate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left . 24 : 7 The new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merryhearted do sigh . 24	l
the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the earth do shake . 24 : 19 The earth is utterly broken down , the earth is clean dissolved , the earth is moved exceedingly . 24 : 20 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon	s
shall the strong people glorify thee , the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee . 25 : 4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor , a strength to the needy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall . 25 : 5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the	s
terrible ones shall be brought low . 25 : 6 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined . 25 : 7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people , and the vail that is spread over all nations . 25 : 8 He will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the LORD hath spoken it . 25 : 9 And it shall be said in that day , Lo , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the LORD ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation . 25 : 10 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest , and Moab shall be	l
in the land of Judah ; We have a strong city ; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks . 26 : 2 Open ye the gates , that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in . 26 : 3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee . 26 : 4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever : for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength : 26 : 5 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high ; the lofty city , he layeth it low ; he layeth it low , even to the ground ; he bringeth it even to the dust . 26 : 6 The foot shall tread it down , even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the needy . 26 : 7 The way of the just is uprightness : thou , most upright , dost weigh the path of the just . 26 : 8 Yea , in the way of thy judgments , O LORD , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is	l
dew is as the dew of herbs , and the earth shall cast out the dead . 26 : 20 Come , my people , enter thou into thy chambers , and shut thy doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast . 26 : 21 For , behold , the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity : the earth also shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her slain . 27 : 1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea . 27 : 2 In that day sing ye unto her , A vineyard of red wine . 27 : 3 I the LORD do keep it ; I will water it every moment : lest any hurt it , I will keep it night and day . 27 : 4 Fury is not in me : who would set the briers and thorns against	l
, to the drunkards of Ephraim , whose glorious beauty is a fading flower , which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine ! 28 : 2 Behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand . 28 : 3 The crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim , shall be trodden under feet : 28 : 4 And the glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fat valley , shall be a fading flower , and as the hasty fruit before the summer ; which when he that looketh upon it seeth , while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up . 28 : 5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people , 28 : 6 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to	l
hell are we at agreement ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , it shall not come unto us : for we have made lies our refuge , and under falsehood have we hid ourselves : 28 : 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD , Behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : he that believeth shall not make haste . 28 : 17 Judgment also will I lay to the line , and righteousness to the plummet : and the	s
sleep , and hath closed your eyes : the prophets and your rulers , the seers hath he covered . 29 : 11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed , which men deliver to one that is learned , saying , Read this , I pray thee : and he saith , I cannot ; for it is sealed : 29 : 12 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned , saying , Read this , I pray thee : and he saith ,	s
: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it . 30 : 33 For Tophet is ordained of old ; yea , for the king it is prepared ; he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much wood ; the breath of the LORD , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it . 31 : 1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help ; and stay on horses , and trust in chariots , because they are many ; and in horsemen , because they are	s
upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . 37 : 8 So Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish . 37 : 9 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , He is come forth to make war with thee . And when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying , 37 : 10	s
the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men ' s hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them . 37 : 20 Now therefore , O LORD our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD , even thou only . 37 : 21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria : 37 : 22 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him ; The virgin , the daughter of Zion , hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee . 37 : 23 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel . 37 : 24 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord , and hast said , By the multitude of my chariots	l
and plant vineyards , and eat the fruit thereof . 37 : 31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward : 37 : 32 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this . 37 : 33 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it	s
: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth . 38 : 19 The living , the living , he shall praise thee , as I do this day : the father to the children shall make known thy truth . 38 : 20 The LORD was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD . 38 : 21 For Isaiah had said , Let them take a lump of figs , and lay it for a	s
What have they seen in thine house ? And Hezekiah answered , All that is in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them . 39 : 5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah , Hear the word of the LORD of hosts : 39 : 6 Behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the LORD . 39	s
the word of our God shall stand for ever . 40 : 9 O Zion , that bringest good tidings , get thee up into the high mountain ; O Jerusalem , that bringest good tidings , lift up thy voice with strength ; lift it up , be not afraid ; say unto the cities of Judah , Behold your God ! 40 : 10 Behold , the Lord GOD will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him . 40 : 11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young . 40 : 12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and meted out heaven with the span , and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales , and the hills in a balance ? 40 : 13 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD , or being his	l
, that bringeth out their host by number : he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might , for that he is strong in power ; not one faileth . 40 : 27 Why sayest thou , O Jacob , and speakest , O Israel , My way is hid from the LORD , and my judgment is passed over from my God ? 40 : 28 Hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , the LORD , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding . 40 : 29 He giveth power to the faint ; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength . 40 : 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary , and the young men shall utterly fall : 40 : 31 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eagles ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint . 41 : 1 Keep	l
silence before me , O islands ; and let the people renew their strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us come near together to judgment . 41 : 2 Who raised up the righteous man from the east , called him to his foot , gave the nations before him , and made him rule over kings ? he gave them as the dust to his sword , and as driven stubble to his bow . 41 : 3 He pursued them , and passed safely ; even by the way that he	s
cast thee away . 41 : 10 Fear thou not ; for I am with thee : be not dismayed ; for I am thy God : I will strengthen thee ; yea , I will help thee ; yea , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness . 41 : 11 Behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish . 41 : 12 Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them ,	s
and understand together , that the hand of the LORD hath done this , and the Holy One of Israel hath created it . 41 : 21 Produce your cause , saith the LORD ; bring forth your strong reasons , saith the King of Jacob . 41 : 22 Let them bring them forth , and shew us what shall happen : let them shew the former things , what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things for to come . 41 : 23 Shew the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that ye are gods : yea , do good , or do evil , that we may be dismayed , and behold it together . 41 : 24 Behold , ye are of nothing , and your work of nought : an abomination is he that chooseth you . 41 : 25 I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter	l
; even among them , and there was no counsellor , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word . 41 : 29 Behold , they are all vanity ; their works are nothing : their molten images are wind and confusion . 42 : 1 Behold my servant , whom I uphold ; mine elect , in whom my soul delighteth ; I have put my spirit upon him : he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles . 42 : 2 He shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause his voice to be heard in the street . 42 : 3 A bruised reed shall he not break , and the smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth . 42 : 4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set judgment in the earth : and the isles shall wait for his law . 42 : 5 Thus saith God the LORD , he that created the heavens , and stretched them out ; he that spread forth the earth , and that which cometh out of it ; he	l
. These things will I do unto them , and not forsake them . 42 : 17 They shall be turned back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in graven images , that say to the molten images , Ye are our gods . 42 : 18 Hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see . 42 : 19 Who is blind , but my servant ? or deaf , as my messenger that I sent ? who is blind as he that is perfect , and blind as the LORD ' s servant ? 42 : 20 Seeing many things , but thou observest not ; opening the ears , but he heareth not . 42 : 21 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness ' sake ; he will magnify the law , and make it honourable . 42 : 22 But this is a people robbed and spoiled ; they are all of them snared in holes , and they are hid in prison houses : they are for a prey , and none delivereth ; for a spoil , and none saith , Restore .	l
he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart . 43 : 1 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel , Fear not : for I have redeemed thee , I have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine . 43 : 2 When thou passest through the waters , I will be with thee ; and through the rivers , they shall not overflow thee : when thou walkest through the fire , thou shalt not be burned ; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee . 43 : 3 For I am the LORD thy God , the Holy One of Israel , thy Saviour : I gave Egypt for thy ransom , Ethiopia and Seba for thee . 43 : 4 Since thou wast precious in my sight , thou hast been honourable , and I have loved thee : therefore will I give men for thee , and people for thy life . 43 : 5 Fear not : for I am with thee : I will bring thy seed from the east	l
, and gather thee from the west ; 43 : 6 I will say to the north , Give up ; and to the south , Keep not back : bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth ; 43 : 7 Even every one that is called by my name : for I have created him for my glory , I have formed him ; yea , I have made him . 43 : 8 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes , and the deaf that have ears . 43	s
43 : 14 Thus saith the LORD , your redeemer , the Holy One of Israel ; For your sake I have sent to Babylon , and have brought down all their nobles , and the Chaldeans , whose cry is in the ships . 43 : 15 I am the LORD , your Holy One , the creator of Israel , your King . 43 : 16 Thus saith the LORD , which maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ; 43 : 17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse ,	s
pray unto a god that cannot save . 45 : 21 Tell ye , and bring them near ; yea , let them take counsel together : who hath declared this from ancient time ? who hath told it from that time ? have not I the LORD ? and there is no God else beside me ; a just God and a Saviour ; there is none beside me . 45 : 22 Look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I am God , and there is none else	s
your old age I am he ; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you : I have made , and I will bear ; even I will carry , and will deliver you . 46 : 5 To whom will ye liken me , and make me equal , and compare me , that we may be like ? 46 : 6 They lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .	s
46 : 7 They bear him upon the shoulder , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he standeth ; from his place shall he not remove : yea , one shall cry unto him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble . 46 : 8 Remember this , and shew yourselves men : bring it again to mind , O ye transgressors . 46 : 9 Remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me , 46 : 10 Declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , My counsel shall stand , and I will do all my pleasure : 46 : 11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man that executeth my counsel from a far country : yea , I have spoken it , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed it , I will also do it . 46 : 12 Hearken unto me ,	l
. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge , it hath perverted thee ; and thou hast said in thine heart , I am , and none else beside me . 47 : 11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee ; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth : and mischief shall fall upon thee ; thou shalt not be able to put it off : and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly , which thou shalt not know . 47 : 12 Stand now with thine enchantments , and with the multitude of thy sorceries , wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou mayest prevail . 47 : 13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels . Let now the astrologers , the stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee . 47 : 14 Behold , they shall be as stubble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : there shall not be a coal to warm at ,	l
I have refined thee , but not with silver ; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction . 48 : 11 For mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will I do it : for how should my name be polluted ? and I will not give my glory unto another . 48 : 12 Hearken unto me , O Jacob and Israel , my called ; I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last . 48 : 13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand hath spanned the heavens : when I call unto them , they stand up together . 48 : 14 All ye , assemble yourselves , and hear ; which among them hath declared these things ? The LORD hath loved him : he will do his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans . 48 : 15 I , even I , have spoken ; yea , I have called him : I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous . 48 : 16 Come ye	l
near unto me , hear ye this ; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I : and now the Lord GOD , and his Spirit , hath sent me . 48 : 17 Thus saith the LORD , thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel ; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit , which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go . 48 : 18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments ! then had thy peace been	s
haste ; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee . 49 : 18 Lift up thine eyes round about , and behold : all these gather themselves together , and come to thee . As I live , saith the LORD , thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all , as with an ornament , and bind them on thee , as a bride doeth . 49 : 19 For thy waste and thy desolate places , and the land of thy destruction , shall even now be too narrow by reason of	s
thy feet ; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD : for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me . 49 : 24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captive delivered ? 49 : 25 But thus saith the LORD , Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered : for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee , and I will save thy children . 49 : 26 And I will feed them that oppress	s
, and her desert like the garden of the LORD ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of melody . 51 : 4 Hearken unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people . 51 : 5 My righteousness is near ; my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the isles shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust . 51 : 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens , and look upon the earth beneath : for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke , and the earth shall wax old like a garment , and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner : but my salvation shall be for ever , and my righteousness shall not be abolished . 51 : 7 Hearken unto me , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear ye not the reproach of men ,	l
neither be ye afraid of their revilings . 51 : 8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool : but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation . 51 : 9 Awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the LORD ; awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of old . Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab , and wounded the dragon ? 51 : 10 Art thou not it which	s
the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again : 51 : 23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee ; which have said to thy soul , Bow down , that we may go over : and thou hast laid thy body as the ground , and as the street , to them that went over . 52 : 1 Awake , awake ; put on thy strength , O Zion ; put on thy beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall	s
no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean . 52 : 2 Shake thyself from the dust ; arise , and sit down , O Jerusalem : loose thyself from the bands of thy neck , O captive daughter of Zion . 52 : 3 For thus saith the LORD , Ye have sold yourselves for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money . 52 : 4 For thus saith the Lord GOD , My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there ; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause . 52 : 5 Now therefore , what have I here , saith the LORD , that my people is taken away for nought ? they that rule over them make them to howl , saith the LORD ; and my name continually every day is blasphemed . 52 : 6 Therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak : behold , it is I . 52 : 7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ; that bringeth	l
is near : 55 : 7 Let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the LORD , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon . 55 : 8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , saith the LORD . 55 : 9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts . 55 : 10 For as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater : 55 : 11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it . 55 : 12 For ye shall go out	l
with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands . 55 : 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to the LORD for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off . 56 : 1 Thus saith the LORD , Keep ye judgment , and do justice : for	s
my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed . 56 : 2 Blessed is the man that doeth this , and the son of man that layeth hold on it ; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it , and keepeth his hand from doing any evil . 56 : 3 Neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the LORD , speak , saying , The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people : neither let the eunuch say , Behold , I am a dry tree . 56 : 4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and take hold of my covenant ; 56 : 5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters : I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off . 56 : 6 Also the sons of the stranger , that join themselves to the LORD , to serve him , and to love the	l
he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth . 62 : 8 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies ; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine , for the which thou hast laboured : 62 : 9 But they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the LORD ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness . 62 :	s
And I will tread down the people in mine anger , and make them drunk in my fury , and I will bring down their strength to the earth . 63 : 7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD , and the praises of the LORD , according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us , and the great goodness toward the house of Israel , which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses . 63 : 8 For he said , Surely they are my people , children that will not lie : so he was their Saviour . 63 : 9 In all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bare them , and carried them all the days of old . 63 : 10 But they rebelled , and vexed his holy Spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he fought against them . 63 : 11 Then he remembered the days of old , Moses	l
, and his people , saying , Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock ? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him ? 63 : 12 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm , dividing the water before them , to make himself an everlasting name ? 63 : 13 That led them through the deep , as an horse in the wilderness , that they should not stumble ? 63 : 14 As a beast goeth down into the valley	s
, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest : so didst thou lead thy people , to make thyself a glorious name . 63 : 15 Look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me ? are they restrained ? 63 : 16 Doubtless thou art our father , though Abraham be ignorant of us , and Israel acknowledge us not : thou , O LORD , art our father , our redeemer ; thy name is from everlasting . 63 : 17 O LORD , why hast thou made us to err from thy ways , and hardened our heart from thy fear ? Return for thy servants ' sake , the tribes of thine inheritance . 63 : 18 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary . 63 : 19 We are thine : thou never barest rule over them ; they were not called by thy name . 64 : 1 Oh that thou	l
forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there . 65 : 10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me . 65 : 11 But ye are they that forsake the LORD , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that furnish the drink offering unto that number . 65 : 12 Therefore will I number you to the sword , and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter : because when I called , ye did not answer ; when I spake , ye did not hear ; but did evil before mine eyes , and did choose that wherein I delighted not . 65 : 13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD , Behold , my servants shall eat , but ye shall be hungry : behold , my servants shall drink , but ye shall be thirsty : behold , my servants shall	l
will hear . 65 : 25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock : and dust shall be the serpent ' s meat . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , saith the LORD . 66 : 1 Thus saith the LORD , The heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : where is the house that ye build unto me ? and where is the place of my rest ? 66 : 2 For all those things hath mine hand made , and all those things have been , saith the LORD : but to this man will I look , even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit , and trembleth at my word . 66 : 3 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man ; he that sacrificeth a lamb , as if he cut off a dog ' s neck ; he that offereth an oblation , as if he offered swine ' s blood ; he that burneth incense , as if he blessed an idol .	l
' s sake , said , Let the LORD be glorified : but he shall appear to your joy , and they shall be ashamed . 66 : 6 A voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies . 66 : 7 Before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she was delivered of a man child . 66 : 8 Who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seen such things ? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day ? or shall a nation be born at once ? for as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children . 66 : 9 Shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? saith the LORD : shall I cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ? saith thy God . 66 : 10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem , and be glad with her , all ye that love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn for her : 66	l
: 11 That ye may suck , and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory . 66 : 12 For thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream : then shall ye suck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be dandled upon her knees . 66 : 13 As one whom his mother comforteth , so will I comfort you	s
, the love of thine espousals , when thou wentest after me in the wilderness , in a land that was not sown . 2 : 3 Israel was holiness unto the LORD , and the firstfruits of his increase : all that devour him shall offend ; evil shall come upon them , saith the LORD . 2 : 4 Hear ye the word of the LORD , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel : 2 : 5 Thus saith the LORD , What iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ? 2 : 6 Neither said they , Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , that led us through the wilderness , through a land of deserts and of pits , through a land of drought , and of the shadow of death , through a land that no man passed through , and where no man dwelt ? 2 : 7 And I brought you into a plentiful country , to eat	l
the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof ; but when ye entered , ye defiled my land , and made mine heritage an abomination . 2 : 8 The priests said not , Where is the LORD ? and they that handle the law knew me not : the pastors also transgressed against me , and the prophets prophesied by Baal , and walked after things that do not profit . 2 : 9 Wherefore I will yet plead with you , saith the LORD , and with your children ' s children will I plead . 2 : 10	s
hast forsaken the LORD thy God , when he led thee by the way ? 2 : 18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Sihor ? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria , to drink the waters of the river ? 2 : 19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee , and thy backslidings shall reprove thee : know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God , and that my	s
: 36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt , as thou wast ashamed of Assyria . 2 : 37 Yea , thou shalt go forth from him , and thine hands upon thine head : for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences , and thou shalt not prosper in them . 3 : 1 They say , If a man put away his wife , and she go from him , and become another man ' s , shall he return unto her again ? shall not that land be greatly polluted ? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers ; yet return again to me , saith the LORD . 3 : 2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been lien with . In the ways hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness . 3 : 3 Therefore the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; and thou hadst a whore	l
mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the harlot . 3 : 7 And I said after she had done all these things , Turn thou unto me . But she returned not . And her treacherous sister Judah saw it . 3 : 8 And I saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also . 3 : 9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom , that she defiled the land , and committed adultery with stones and with stocks . 3 : 10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart , but feignedly , saith the LORD . 3 : 11 And the LORD said unto me , The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah . 3 : 12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou backsliding Israel , saith the LORD ; and I	l
will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for I am merciful , saith the LORD , and I will not keep anger for ever . 3 : 13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God , and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , saith the LORD . 3 : 14 Turn , O backsliding children , saith the LORD ; for I am married unto you : and I will take you one of a city	s
, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them , a leopard shall watch over their cities : every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces : because their transgressions are many , and their backslidings are increased . 5 : 7 How shall I pardon thee for this ? thy children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses . 5 : 8 They were as fed horses in the morning : every one neighed after his neighbour ' s wife . 5 : 9 Shall I not visit for these things ? saith the LORD : and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ? 5 : 10 Go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her battlements ; for they are not the LORD ' s . 5 : 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith	l
say , Hear the word of the LORD , all ye of Judah , that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD . 7 : 3 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place . 7 : 4 Trust ye not in lying words , saying , The temple of the LORD , The temple of the LORD , The temple of the LORD , are these . 7 : 5 For if ye throughly amend your	s
their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD . 8 : 8 How do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the LORD is with us ? Lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain . 8 : 9 The wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the LORD ; and what wisdom is in them ? 8 : 10 Therefore will I give their wives unto others , and	s
of heaven ; for the heathen are dismayed at them . 10 : 3 For the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe . 10 : 4 They deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not . 10 : 5 They are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they cannot go . Be not afraid of them ; for they cannot do evil , neither also is it in them to do good . 10 : 6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee , O LORD ; thou art great , and thy name is great in might . 10 : 7 Who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? for to thee doth it appertain : forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto thee . 10 : 8 But they are altogether brutish	l
10 : 11 Thus shall ye say unto them , The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , even they shall perish from the earth , and from under these heavens . 10 : 12 He hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion . 10 : 13 When he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures . 10 : 14 Every man is brutish in his knowledge : every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them . 10 : 15 They are vanity , and the work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish . 10 : 16 The portion of Jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod	l
and their daughters shall die by famine : 11 : 23 And there shall be no remnant of them : for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation . 12 : 1 Righteous art thou , O LORD , when I plead with thee : yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments : Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper ? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously ? 12 : 2 Thou hast planted them , yea , they have taken root : they grow	s
will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , saith the LORD : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy , but destroy them . 13 : 15 Hear ye , and give ear ; be not proud : for the LORD hath spoken . 13 : 16 Give glory to the LORD your God , before he cause darkness , and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make	s
the LORD , even lovingkindness and mercies . 16 : 6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them : 16 : 7 Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother . 16 : 8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting ,	s
Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Even so will I break this people and this city , as one breaketh a potter ' s vessel , that cannot be made whole again : and they shall bury them in Tophet , till there be no place to bury . 19 : 12 Thus will I do unto this place , saith the LORD , and to the inhabitants thereof , and even make this city as Tophet : 19 : 13 And the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses of the kings of Judah , shall be defiled	s
the morrow , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . Then said Jeremiah unto him , The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur , but Magormissabib . 20 : 4 For thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will make thee a terror to thyself , and to all thy friends : and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies , and thine eyes shall behold it : and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall carry them captive into Babylon , and	s
shall slay them with the sword . 20 : 5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the labours thereof , and all the precious things thereof , and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies , which shall spoil them , and take them , and carry them to Babylon . 20 : 6 And thou , Pashur , and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity : and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou , and all thy friends , to whom thou hast prophesied lies . 20 : 7 O LORD , thou hast deceived me , and I was deceived ; thou art stronger than I , and hast prevailed : I am in derision daily , every one mocketh me . 20 : 8 For since I spake , I cried out , I cried violence and spoil ; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me , and a derision , daily . 20 : 9 Then I	l
shall take our revenge on him . 20 : 11 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten . 20 : 12 But , O LORD of hosts , that triest the righteous , and seest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause . 20 : 13 Sing unto the LORD , praise ye the LORD : for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers . 20 : 14 Cursed be the day wherein I was born : let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed . 20 : 15 Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , A man child is born unto thee ; making him very glad . 20 : 16 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew , and repented not : and let him hear the	l
of your doings . 21 : 13 Behold , I am against thee , O inhabitant of the valley , and rock of the plain , saith the LORD ; which say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ? 21 : 14 But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the LORD : and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it . 22 : 1 Thus saith the LORD ; Go down to	s
Judah ; Thou art Gilead unto me , and the head of Lebanon : yet surely I will make thee a wilderness , and cities which are not inhabited . 22 : 7 And I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down thy choice cedars , and cast them into the fire . 22 : 8 And many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city ? 22 : 9 Then	s
, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers . 25 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; 25 : 2 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying , 25 : 3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the LORD hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened . 25 : 4 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear . 25 : 5 They said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of	l
21 Edom , and Moab , and the children of Ammon , 25 : 22 And all the kings of Tyrus , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea , 25 : 23 Dedan , and Tema , and Buz , and all that are in the utmost corners , 25 : 24 And all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert , 25 : 25 And all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of	s
26 : 10 When the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king ' s house unto the house of the LORD , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD ' s house . 26 : 11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy to die ; for he hath prophesied against this city , as ye have heard with your ears . 26 : 12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard . 26 : 13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the LORD your God ; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you . 26 : 14 As for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you . 26 : 15 But know ye for	l
words , the king sought to put him to death : but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ; 26 : 22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , namely , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him into Egypt . 26 : 23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt , and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king ; who slew him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people . 26 : 24	s
, 28 : 6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said , Amen : the LORD do so : the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied , to bring again the vessels of the LORD ' s house , and all that is carried away captive , from Babylon into this place . 28 : 7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ; 28 : 8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence . 28 : 9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the LORD hath truly sent him . 28 : 10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah ' s neck , and brake it . 28 : 11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people , saying , Thus saith the LORD ; Even so will I break	l
will not make a full end of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether unpunished . 30 : 12 For thus saith the LORD , Thy bruise is incurable , and thy wound is grievous . 30 : 13 There is none to plead thy cause , that thou mayest be bound up : thou hast no healing medicines . 30 : 14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee ; they seek thee not ; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the multitude of thine iniquity ; because thy sins were increased . 30 : 15 Why criest thou for thine affliction ? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity : because thy sins were increased , I have done these things unto thee . 30 : 16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured ; and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will I give for	l
keep him , as a shepherd doth his flock . 31 : 11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob , and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he . 31 : 12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion , and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD , for wheat , and for wine , and for oil , and for the young of the flock and of the herd : and their soul shall be as a watered garden ; and they shall not sorrow any more at all . 31 : 13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together : for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow . 31 : 14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , saith the LORD . 31 : 15 Thus saith the LORD ; A voice was heard in Ramah , lamentation , and bitter weeping ; Rahel weeping for her children refused	l
to be comforted for her children , because they were not . 31 : 16 Thus saith the LORD ; Refrain thy voice from weeping , and thine eyes from tears : for thy work shall be rewarded , saith the LORD ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy . 31 : 17 And there is hope in thine end , saith the LORD , that thy children shall come again to their own border . 31 : 18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus ; Thou hast chastised me , and I	s
of Kidron , unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east , shall be holy unto the LORD ; it shall not be plucked up , nor thrown down any more for ever . 32 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar . 32 : 2 For then the king of Babylon ' s army besieged Jerusalem : and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Judah ' s house . 32 : 3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up , saying , Wherefore dost thou prophesy , and say , Thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it ; 32 : 4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his	l
: 8 So Hanameel mine uncle ' s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD , and said unto me , Buy my field , I pray thee , that is in Anathoth , which is in the country of Benjamin : for the right of inheritance is thine , and the redemption is thine ; buy it for thyself . Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD . 32 : 9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle ' s son , that was in Anathoth , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver . 32 : 10 And I subscribed the evidence , and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances . 32 : 11 So I took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and custom , and that which was open : 32 : 12 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , the son of Maaseiah , in the sight of Hanameel	l
15 For thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land . 32 : 16 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed unto the LORD , saying , 32 : 17 Ah Lord GOD ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee : 32 : 18 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them : the Great , the Mighty God , the LORD of hosts , is his name , 32 : 19 Great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings : 32 : 20 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even unto this day , and in Israel ,	l
the cities of Judah , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them , saith the LORD . 33 : 14 Behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah . 33 : 15 In those days , and at that time , will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David ; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land . 33 : 16 In those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The LORD our righteousness . 33 : 17 For thus saith the LORD ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ; 33 : 18 Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings , and to kindle meat offerings , and to do sacrifice continually . 33 : 19 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah , saying ,	l
every man to his neighbour : behold , I proclaim a liberty for you , saith the LORD , to the sword , to the pestilence , and to the famine ; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth . 34 : 18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the calf in twain , and passed between the parts thereof , 34 : 19 The princes of Judah , and the princes of Jerusalem , the eunuchs , and the priests , and all the people of the land , which passed between the parts of the calf ; 34 : 20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven , and to the beasts of the earth . 34 : 21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their	l
Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , unto Baruch , saying , Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people , and come . So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand , and came unto them . 36 : 15 And they said unto him , Sit down now , and read it in our ears . So Baruch read it in their ears . 36 : 16 Now it came to pass , when they had heard all the words , they were afraid both one	s
out of Egypt : and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from Jerusalem . 37 : 6 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying , 37 : 7 Thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to enquire of me ; Behold , Pharaoh ' s army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land . 37 : 8 And the Chaldeans	s
to the Chaldeans . 37 : 14 Then said Jeremiah , It is false ; I fall not away to the Chaldeans . But he hearkened not to him : so Irijah took Jeremiah , and brought him to the princes . 37 : 15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison . 37 : 16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon , and into the cabins , and Jeremiah had remained there many	s
days ; 37 : 17 Then Zedekiah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the LORD ? And Jeremiah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon . 37 : 18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah , What have I offended against thee , or against thy servants , or against this people , that ye have put me in prison ? 37 : 19 Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ? 37 : 20 Therefore hear now , I pray thee , O my lord the king : let my supplication , I pray thee , be accepted before thee ; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there . 37 : 21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they	l
should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent . Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison . 38 : 1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashur the son of Malchiah , heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people , saying , 38 : 2 Thus saith the LORD , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword ,	s
prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD : and the king said unto Jeremiah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me . 38 : 15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah , If I declare it unto thee , wilt thou not surely put me to death ? and if I give thee counsel , wilt thou not hearken unto me ? 38 : 16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah , saying , As the LORD liveth , that made us this soul , I	s
them according to all these words that the king had commanded . So they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived . 38 : 28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken : and he was there when Jerusalem was taken . 39 : 1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they besieged it . 39 : 2 And in the eleventh year of	s
, and dwell with him among the people : or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go . So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward , and let him go . 40 : 6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land . 40 : 7 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed unto him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon ; 40 : 8 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men . 40 : 9 And Gedaliah	l
and returned , and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah . 41 : 15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to the Ammonites . 41 : 16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , from Mizpah , after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , even mighty men of war , and the women , and the children , and the eunuchs , whom he had brought again from Gibeon : 41 : 17 And they departed , and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt , 41 : 18 Because of the Chaldeans : for they were afraid of them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land . 42 : 1 Then all the captains of the forces , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and	l
Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest , came near , 42 : 2 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet , Let , we beseech thee , our supplication be accepted before thee , and pray for us unto the LORD thy God , even for all this remnant ; ( for we are left but a few of many , as thine eyes do behold us :) 42 : 3 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk , and the thing that	s
: 22 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn . 43 : 1 And it came to pass , that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God , for which the LORD their God had sent him to them , even all these words , 43 : 2 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah , and Johanan the son of Kareah	s
out drink offerings unto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings unto her , without our men ? 44 : 20 Then Jeremiah said unto all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying , 44 : 21 The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , ye , and your fathers , your kings , and your princes , and the people of the	s
stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines . 46 : 5 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the LORD . 46 : 6 Let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stumble , and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates . 46 : 7 Who is this that cometh up as a flood	s
woman in travail . 49 : 25 How is the city of praise not left , the city of my joy ! 49 : 26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the LORD of hosts . 49 : 27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus , and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad . 49 : 28 Concerning Kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite , thus saith the LORD ; Arise ye , go up to Kedar , and spoil the men of the east . 49 : 29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry unto them , Fear is on every side . 49 : 30 Flee , get you far off , dwell deep , O ye inhabitants of Hazor , saith the LORD ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath	l
conceived a purpose against you . 49 : 31 Arise , get you up unto the wealthy nation , that dwelleth without care , saith the LORD , which have neither gates nor bars , which dwell alone . 49 : 32 And their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their cattle a spoil : and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners ; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof , saith the LORD . 49 : 33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons	s
, and a desolation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it . 49 : 34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying , 49 : 35 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Behold , I will break the bow of Elam , the chief of their might . 49 : 36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come . 49 : 37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and I will bring evil upon them , even my fierce anger , saith the LORD ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them : 49 : 38 And I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes ,	l
39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there , and the owls shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation . 50 : 40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof , saith the LORD ; so shall no man abide there , neither shall any son of man dwell therein . 50 : 41 Behold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation ,	s
2 And will send unto Babylon fanners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about . 51 : 3 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine : and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host . 51 : 4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans , and they that are thrust through in her streets . 51 : 5 For Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel . 51 : 6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the LORD ' s vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence . 51 : 7 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD ' s hand , that made all the	l
work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish . 51 : 19 The portion of Jacob is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the LORD of hosts is his name . 51 : 20 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war : for with thee will I break in pieces the nations , and with thee will I destroy kingdoms ; 51 : 21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider ; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider ; 51 : 22 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ; 51 : 23 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and	l
, nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the LORD . 51 : 27 Set ye up a standard in the land , blow the trumpet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashchenaz ; appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers . 51 : 28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion . 51 : 29 And the land shall tremble and sorrow : for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon , to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant . 51 : 30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken . 51 : 31 One post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet	l
the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away . 52 : 20 The two pillars , one sea , and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD : the brass of all these vessels was without weight . 52 : 21 And concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits ; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow . 52 : 22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass . The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these . 52 : 23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side ; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about . 52 : 24 And	l
of her transgressions : her children are gone into captivity before the enemy . 1 : 6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , and they are gone without strength before the pursuer . 1 : 7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old , when her people fell into the hand of the enemy , and none did help her : the adversaries saw her ,	s
and did mock at her sabbaths . 1 : 8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned ; therefore she is removed : all that honoured her despise her , because they have seen her nakedness : yea , she sigheth , and turneth backward . 1 : 9 Her filthiness is in her skirts ; she remembereth not her last end ; therefore she came down wonderfully : she had no comforter . O LORD , behold my affliction : for the enemy hath magnified himself . 1 : 10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things : for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation . 1 : 11 All her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O LORD , and consider ; for I am become vile . 1 : 12 Is it nothing to you , all ye that pass by ? behold , and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow , which is done unto me ,	l
builded against me , and compassed me with gall and travail . 3 : 6 He hath set me in dark places , as they that be dead of old . 3 : 7 He hath hedged me about , that I cannot get out : he hath made my chain heavy . 3 : 8 Also when I cry and shout , he shutteth out my prayer . 3 : 9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone , he hath made my paths crooked . 3 : 10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait , and as a lion in secret places . 3 : 11 He hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hath made me desolate . 3 : 12 He hath bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow . 3 : 13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins . 3 : 14 I was a derision to all my people ; and their song all the day . 3 : 15 He hath filled me with bitterness , he hath made	l
to my mind , therefore have I hope . 3 : 22 It is of the LORD ' s mercies that we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not . 3 : 23 They are new every morning : great is thy faithfulness . 3 : 24 The LORD is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will I hope in him . 3 : 25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him , to the soul that seeketh him . 3 : 26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD . 3 : 27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth . 3 : 28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence , because he hath borne it upon him . 3 : 29 He putteth his mouth in the dust ; if so be there may be hope . 3 : 30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him : he is filled full with reproach . 3 : 31 For the LORD will not cast off for ever : 3 : 32	l
be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger : for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field . 4 : 10 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people . 4 : 11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury ; he hath poured out his fierce anger , and hath kindled a fire in Zion , and it hath devoured the foundations thereof . 4 : 12 The kings of	s
, though they be a rebellious house . 2 : 7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear : for they are most rebellious . 2 : 8 But thou , son of man , hear what I say unto thee ; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house : open thy mouth , and eat that I give thee . 2 : 9 And when I looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ; 2 : 10 And he spread it before me ; and it was written within and without : and there was written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe . 3 : 1 Moreover he said unto me , Son of man , eat that thou findest ; eat this roll , and go speak unto the house of Israel . 3 : 2 So I opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat that roll . 3 : 3 And he said unto me , Son of man , cause thy belly to	l
5 : 14 Moreover I will make thee waste , and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by . 5 : 15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee , when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes . I the LORD have spoken it . 5 : 16 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread : 5 : 17 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts , and they shall bereave thee : and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee ; and I will bring the sword upon thee . I the LORD have spoken it . 6 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 6 : 2 Son of man , set thy face	l
before your idols . 6 : 5 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars . 6 : 6 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste , and the high places shall be desolate ; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate , and your idols may be broken and cease , and your images may be cut down , and your works may be abolished . 6 : 7 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that I am the LORD . 6 : 8 Yet will I leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries . 6 : 9 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives , because I am broken with their whorish heart , which hath departed from me , and with their eyes , which go a whoring after their idols : and they	l
: none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of any of their ' s : neither shall there be wailing for them . 7 : 12 The time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn : for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof . 7 : 13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any	s
; and they shall pollute it . 7 : 22 My face will I turn also from them , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robbers shall enter into it , and defile it . 7 : 23 Make a chain : for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence . 7 : 24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be defiled . 7 : 25 Destruction cometh ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none . 7 : 26 Mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the ancients . 7 : 27 The king shall mourn , and the prince shall be clothed with desolation , and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled : I will do unto them after their way	l
, and according to their deserts will I judge them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD . 8 : 1 And it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me . 8 : 2 Then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward	s
, fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of amber . 8 : 3 And he put forth the form of an hand , and took me by a lock of mine head ; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven , and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem , to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north ; where was the seat of the image of jealousy , which provoketh to jealousy . 8 : 4 And , behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the plain . 8 : 5 Then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north . So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry . 8 : 6 He said furthermore unto me , Son of man , seest thou what they do ? even the great	l
weapon in his hand ; and one man among them was clothed with linen , with a writer ' s inkhorn by his side : and they went in , and stood beside the brasen altar . 9 : 3 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . And he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer ' s inkhorn by his side ; 9 : 4 And the LORD said unto him , Go through the	s
: 11 And , behold , the man clothed with linen , which had the inkhorn by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as thou hast commanded me . 10 : 1 Then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne . 10 : 2 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen , and said , Go in between the wheels , even under the cherub , and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims , and scatter them over the city . And he went in in my sight . 10 : 3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court . 10 : 4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full	l
saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur , and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah , princes of the people . 11 : 2 Then said he unto me , Son of man , these are the men that devise mischief , and give wicked counsel in this city : 11 : 3 Which say , It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we be the flesh . 11 : 4 Therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , O son of man . 11 : 5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me , and said unto me , Speak ; Thus saith the LORD ; Thus have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them . 11 : 6 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain . 11 : 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but	l
, Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen , and although I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come . 11 : 17 Therefore say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel . 11 : 18 And they shall come thither , and	s
me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . So the vision that I had seen went up from me . 11 : 25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me . 12 : 1 The word of the LORD also came unto me , saying , 12 : 2 Son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have	s
, and Job , were in it , they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness , saith the Lord GOD . 14 : 15 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts : 14 : 16 Though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord GOD , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters ; they only shall be delivered , but the land shall be desolate . 14 : 17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land , and say , Sword , go through the land ; so that I cut off man and beast from it : 14 : 18 Though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord GOD , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only shall be delivered themselves . 14 : 19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my fury upon it in blood , to cut off from it man	l
this of thy whoredoms a small matter , 16 : 21 That thou hast slain my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ? 16 : 22 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in thy blood . 16 : 23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness , ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the LORD GOD ;) 16 : 24 That thou hast also built	s
to all thy lovers , and hirest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom . 16 : 34 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms , whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms : and in that thou givest a reward , and no reward is given unto thee , therefore thou art contrary . 16 : 35 Wherefore , O harlot , hear the word of the LORD : 16 : 36 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thy filthiness was poured out , and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers , and with all the idols of thy abominations , and by the blood of thy children , which thou didst give unto them ; 16 : 37 Behold , therefore I will gather all thy lovers , with whom thou hast taken pleasure , and all them that thou hast loved , with all them that thou hast hated ; I will even gather them round about against thee , and will discover thy nakedness unto them , that they may see all thy nakedness . 16 : 38 And I	l
captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them : 16 : 54 That thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them . 16 : 55 When thy sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and	s
of Israel , hath not defiled his neighbour ' s wife , 18 : 16 Neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment , 18 : 17 That hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live . 18 :	s
trespassed , and in his sin that he hath sinned , in them shall he die . 18 : 25 Yet ye say , The way of the LORD is not equal . Hear now , O house of Israel ; Is not my way equal ? are not your ways unequal ? 18 : 26 When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and dieth in them ; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die . 18 : 27 Again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive . 18 : 28 Because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die . 18 : 29 Yet saith the house of Israel , The way of the LORD is not equal . O house of Israel , are not my ways equal ? are not your ways unequal ? 18 : 30 Therefore I will judge you , O house of Israel ,	l
every one according to his ways , saith the Lord GOD . Repent , and turn yourselves from all your transgressions ; so iniquity shall not be your ruin . 18 : 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ? 18 : 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the Lord GOD : wherefore turn yourselves , and live ye . 19 : 1	s
if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols . 20 : 40 For in mine holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , saith the Lord GOD , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve me : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the firstfruits of your oblations , with all your holy things . 20 : 41 I will accept you	s
so that in all your doings your sins do appear ; because , I say , that ye are come to remembrance , ye shall be taken with the hand . 21 : 25 And thou , profane wicked prince of Israel , whose day is come , when iniquity shall have an end , 21 : 26 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high . 21 : 27 I will overturn , overturn , overturn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him . 21 : 28 And thou , son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites , and concerning their reproach ; even say thou , The sword , the sword is drawn : for the slaughter it is furbished , to consume because of the glittering : 21 : 29 Whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee	l
, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end . 21 : 30 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy nativity . 21 : 31 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to	s
upon their heads , saith the Lord GOD . 23 : 1 The word of the LORD came again unto me , saying , 23 : 2 Son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother : 23 : 3 And they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity . 23 : 4 And the names of them were Aholah the elder , and Aholibah her sister : and they were mine , and they	s
bare sons and daughters . Thus were their names ; Samaria is Aholah , and Jerusalem Aholibah . 23 : 5 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians her neighbours , 23 : 6 Which were clothed with blue , captains and rulers , all of them desirable young men , horsemen riding upon horses . 23 : 7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted : with all their idols she defiled herself . 23 : 8 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her . 23 : 9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , upon whom she doted . 23 : 10 These discovered her nakedness : they took her sons and her daughters , and slew her with the sword : and she became famous among women	l
Pekod , and Shoa , and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them : all of them desirable young men , captains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses . 23 : 24 And they shall come against thee with chariots , wagons , and wheels , and with an assembly of people , which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about : and I will set judgment before them , and they shall judge thee according to their judgments . 23 : 25 And I will set my jealousy against thee , and they shall deal furiously with thee : they shall take away thy nose and thine ears ; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword : they shall take thy sons and thy daughters ; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire . 23 : 26 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes , and take away thy fair jewels . 23 : 27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee , and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not	l
, the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones . 24 : 5 Take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them seethe the bones of it therein . 24 : 6 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum is therein , and whose scum is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall upon it . 24 : 7	s
they shall drink thy milk . 25 : 5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks : and ye shall know that I am the LORD . 25 : 6 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast clapped thine hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel ; 25 : 7 Behold , therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen ; and I will cut thee off from the people , and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries : I will destroy thee ; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD . 25 : 8 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because that Moab and Seir do say , Behold , the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen ; 25 : 9 Therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country	l
the Lord GOD ; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword . 25 : 14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the Lord GOD . 25 : 15 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart , to destroy it for the old hatred ; 25 : 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethims , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast . 25 : 17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall lay my vengeance upon them . 26 : 1	l
to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up . 26 : 4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus , and break down her towers : I will also scrape her dust from her , and make her like the top of a rock . 26 : 5 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD : and it shall become a spoil to the nations . 26 : 6 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword ; and they shall know that I am the LORD . 26 : 7 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , a king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and companies , and much people . 26 : 8 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against	l
thee , and lift up the buckler against thee . 26 : 9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls , and with his axes he shall break down thy towers . 26 : 10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee : thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen , and of the wheels , and of the chariots , when he shall enter into thy gates , as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach . 26 : 11 With the hoofs of	s
ship boards of fir trees of Senir : they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee . 27 : 6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim . 27 : 7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee . 27 : 8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners : thy wise men , O Tyrus , that were in thee , were thy pilots . 27 : 9 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise . 27 : 10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness . 27 : 11 The men of Arvad with thine army	l
28 : 26 And they shall dwell safely therein , and shall build houses , and plant vineyards ; yea , they shall dwell with confidence , when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God . 29 : 1 In the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 29 : 2 Son of man , set thy face against Pharaoh king of	s
the Lord GOD . 29 : 17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 29 : 18 Son of man , Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus : every head was made bald , and every shoulder was peeled : yet had he no wages , nor his army , for Tyrus , for the service that he had served against it : 29 : 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall take her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army . 29 : 20 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it , because they wrought for me , saith the Lord GOD . 29 : 21 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to	l
forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it cometh . 30 : 10 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon . 30 : 11 He and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with	s
were stayed : and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him , and all the trees of the field fainted for him . 31 : 16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall , when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit : and all the trees of Eden , the choice and best of Lebanon , all that drink water , shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth . 31 : 17 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen . 31 : 18 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden ? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth : thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword . This is Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord GOD . 32 : 1 And it came to	l
Lord GOD ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net . 32 : 4 Then will I leave thee upon the land , I will cast thee forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee . 32 : 5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with thy height . 32 : 6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of thee . 32 : 7 And when I shall put thee out , I will cover the heaven , and make the stars thereof dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give her light . 32 : 8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the Lord GOD . 32	l
: 9 I will also vex the hearts of many people , when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known . 32 : 10 Yea , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee , when I shall brandish my sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall . 32 : 11 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; The sword of the	s
Lord GOD . 32 : 17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 32 : 18 Son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , unto the nether parts of the earth , with them that go down into the pit . 32 : 19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty ? go down , and be thou laid	s
with the uncircumcised . 32 : 20 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword : draw her and all her multitudes . 32 : 21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him : they are gone down , they lie uncircumcised , slain by the sword . 32 : 22 Asshur is there and all her company : his graves are about him : all of them slain , fallen by the sword : 32 : 23 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living . 32 : 24 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave , all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth , which caused their terror in the land of the living ; yet have they borne their shame with	l
Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord GOD . 33 : 1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 33 : 2 Son of man , speak to the children of thy people , and say unto them , When I bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their coasts , and set him for their watchman : 33 : 3 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ; 33 : 4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warning ; if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head . 33 : 5 He heard the sound of the trumpet , and took not warning ; his blood shall be upon him . But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul . 33 : 6 But if the watchman see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned ; if the sword come , and take	l
one to another , every one to his brother , saying , Come , I pray you , and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD . 33 : 31 And they come unto thee as the people cometh , and they sit before thee as my people , and they hear thy words , but they will not do them : for with their mouth they shew much love , but their heart goeth after their covetousness . 33 : 32 And , lo , thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear thy words , but they do them not . 33 : 33 And when this cometh to pass , ( lo , it will come ,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them . 34 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 34 : 2 Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds	l
cause them to cease from feeding the flock ; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more ; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth , that they may not be meat for them . 34 : 11 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , will both search my sheep , and seek them out . 34 : 12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered ; so will I seek out my sheep , and will deliver them	s
I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate . 35 : 4 I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that I am the LORD . 35 : 5 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred , and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time that their iniquity had an end : 35 : 6 Therefore , as I	s
live , saith the Lord GOD , I will prepare thee unto blood , and blood shall pursue thee : sith thou hast not hated blood , even blood shall pursue thee . 35 : 7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate , and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth . 35 : 8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword . 35 : 9 I will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy cities shall not return : and ye shall know that I am the LORD . 35 : 10 Because thou hast said , These two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas the LORD was there : 35 : 11 Therefore , as I live , saith the Lord GOD , I will even do according to thine anger , and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them ; and I will make myself	l
are inhabited . 36 : 36 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : I the LORD have spoken it , and I will do it . 36 : 37 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel , to do it for them ; I will increase them with men like a flock . 36 : 38 As the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her	s
no breath in them . 37 : 9 Then said he unto me , Prophesy unto the wind , prophesy , son of man , and say to the wind , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Come from the four winds , O breath , and breathe upon these slain , that they may live . 37 : 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me , and the breath came into them , and they lived , and stood up upon their feet , an exceeding great army . 37 : 11 Then he said unto me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say , Our bones are dried , and our hope is lost : we are cut off for our parts . 37 : 12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel . 37 : 13 And ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I	l
have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves , 37 : 14 And shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it , and performed it , saith the LORD . 37 : 15 The word of the LORD came again unto me , saying , 37 : 16 Moreover , thou son of man , take thee one stick , and write upon it , For	s
heathen , whither they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land : 37 : 22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all . 37 : 23 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols , nor with their detestable things , nor with any of their transgressions	s
I am the LORD . 39 : 1 Therefore , thou son of man , prophesy against Gog , and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , O Gog , the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal : 39 : 2 And I will turn thee back , and leave but the sixth part of thee , and will cause thee to come up from the north parts , and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel : 39 : 3 And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand . 39 : 4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel , thou , and all thy bands , and the people that is with thee : I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the beasts of the field to be devoured . 39 : 5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD . 39 : 6 And I will send a fire on Magog , and	l
my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the Lord GOD . 39 : 21 And I will set my glory among the heathen , and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid upon them . 39 : 22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward . 39 : 23 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their	s
toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof : and the going up to it had eight steps . 40 : 32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures . 40 : 33 And the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , were according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .	s
the door were cherubims and palm trees made , and on the wall of the temple . 41 : 21 The posts of the temple were squared , and the face of the sanctuary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other . 41 : 22 The altar of wood was three cubits high , and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof , and the length thereof , and the walls thereof , were of wood : and he said unto me , This is the table that is before the LORD	s
not pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground . 42 : 7 And the wall that was without over against the chambers , toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits . 42 : 8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were an hundred cubits . 42 : 9 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one goeth into them from the utter court . 42 : 10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building . 42 : 11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north , as long as they , and as broad as they : and all their goings out were both according to their fashions , and according to their doors . 42 : 12 And according	l
round about shall be a span : and this shall be the higher place of the altar . 43 : 14 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits , and the breadth one cubit . 43 : 15 So the altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns . 43 : 16 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long , twelve	s
LORD , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut . 44 : 3 It is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same . 44 : 4 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house	s
the house , and ministering to the house : they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them . 44 : 12 Because they ministered unto them before their idols , and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity ; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them , saith the Lord GOD , and they shall bear their iniquity . 44 : 13 And they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed . 44 : 14 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein . 44 : 15 But the priests the Levites , the sons of Zadok , that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me , they shall come near to me	l
the gates of the inner court , and within . 44 : 18 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat . 44 : 19 And when they go forth into the utter court , even into the utter court to the people , they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered , and lay them in the holy chambers , and they shall put on other garments ; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments . 44 : 20 Neither shall they shave their heads , nor suffer their locks to grow long ; they shall only poll their heads . 44 : 21 Neither shall any priest drink wine , when they enter into the inner court . 44 : 22 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before . 44 : 23 And they shall teach my people the difference between	l
of the oblation of the holy portion , and of the possession of the city , before the oblation of the holy portion , and before the possession of the city , from the west side westward , and from the east side eastward : and the length shall be over against one of the portions , from the west border unto the east border . 45 : 8 In the land shall be his possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the	s
first month , in the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten . 45 : 22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering . 45 : 23 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .	s
not be shut until the evening . 46 : 3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons . 46 : 4 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish . 46 : 5 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram , and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give , and an	s
, but shall go forth over against it . 46 : 10 And the prince in the midst of them , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth . 46 : 11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock , and an ephah to a ram , and to the lambs as he is able to give , and an hin of oil to an ephah . 46 : 12 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary	s
the altar . 47 : 2 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side . 47 : 3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ankles . 47 : 4 Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins . 47 : 5 Afterward he measured a thousand ; and it was a river that I could not pass over : for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed over . 47 : 6 And he said unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen this ? Then he brought me , and caused me to return to	l
the brink of the river . 47 : 7 Now when I had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other . 47 : 8 Then said he unto me , These waters issue out toward the east country , and go down into the desert , and go into the sea : which being brought forth into the sea , the waters shall be healed . 47 : 9 And it shall come to pass , that every thing that liveth , which moveth ,	s
as men go to Zedad ; 47 : 16 Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazarhatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran . 47 : 17 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan , the border of Damascus , and the north northward , and the border of Hamath . And this is the north side . 47 : 18 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran , and from Damascus , and from Gilead , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . And this is the east side . 47 : 19 And the south side southward , from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh , the river to the great sea . And this is the south side southward . 47 : 20 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border , till a man come over against Hamath . This is the west side . 47 : 21 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of	l
the firstfruits of the land : for it is holy unto the LORD . 48 : 15 And the five thousand , that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand , shall be a profane place for the city , for dwelling , and for suburbs : and the city shall be in the midst thereof . 48 : 16 And these shall be the measures thereof ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and	s
: 30 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side , four thousand and five hundred measures . 48 : 31 And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates northward ; one gate of Reuben , one gate of Judah , one gate of Levi . 48 : 32 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan . 48 : 33 And	s
then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king . 1 : 11 Then said Daniel to Melzar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , 1 : 12 Prove thy servants , I beseech thee , ten days ; and let them give us pulse to eat , and water to drink . 1 : 13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king ' s meat : and as	s
2 : 20 Daniel answered and said , Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever : for wisdom and might are his : 2 : 21 And he changeth the times and the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings : he giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding : 2 : 22 He revealeth the deep and secret things : he knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him . 2 : 23 I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king ' s matter . 2 : 24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon : he went and said thus unto him ; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon : bring me in before the king , and I will shew unto the king the interpretation . 2 : 25	l
of the province of Babylon : but Daniel sat in the gate of the king . 3 : 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon . 3 : 2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up . 3 : 3 Then the princes , the governors , and captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up ; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up . 3 : 4 Then an herald cried aloud , To you it is commanded , O people , nations , and languages , 3	l
: 5 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up : 3 : 6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace . 3 : 7 Therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and all	s
kinds of musick , all the people , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up . 3 : 8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near , and accused the Jews . 3 : 9 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar , O king , live for ever . 3 : 10 Thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , shall fall down and worship the golden image : 3 : 11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth , that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace . 3 : 12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ; these men , O king , have not regarded thee : they serve not thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up . 3 : 13	l
Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . Then they brought these men before the king . 3 : 14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ? 3 : 15 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds	s
s word , and yielded their bodies , that they might not serve nor worship any god , except their own God . 3 : 29 Therefore I make a decree , That every people , nation , and language , which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , shall be cut in pieces , and their houses shall be made a dunghill : because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort . 3 : 30 Then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , in the province of Babylon . 4 : 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king , unto all people , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth ; Peace be multiplied unto you . 4 : 2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me . 4 : 3 How great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation . 4 : 4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house ,	l
and flourishing in my palace : 4 : 5 I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me . 4 : 6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream . 4 : 7 Then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto	s
at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven , and mine understanding returned unto me , and I blessed the most High , and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever , whose dominion is an everlasting dominion , and his kingdom is from generation to generation : 4 : 35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing : and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven , and among the inhabitants of the earth : and none can stay his hand , or say unto him , What doest thou ? 4 : 36 At the same time my reason returned unto me ; and for the glory of my kingdom , mine honour and brightness returned unto me ; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me ; and I was established in my kingdom , and excellent majesty was added unto me . 4 : 37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven , all whose works are truth , and his ways judgment : and those that walk in pride he is able to	l
which was at Jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , drank in them . 5 : 4 They drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone . 5 : 5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man ' s hand , and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king ' s palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote . 5 : 6 Then the king ' s countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another . 5 : 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers . And the king spake , and said to the wise men of Babylon , Whosoever shall read this writing , and shew me the interpretation thereof , shall be clothed with scarlet , and have a chain of gold about his	l
neck , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom . 5 : 8 Then came in all the king ' s wise men : but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof . 5 : 9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled , and his countenance was changed in him , and his lords were astonied . 5 : 10 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house : and the queen spake and said , O king	s
: 23 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven ; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee , and thou , and thy lords , thy wives , and thy concubines , have drunk wine in them ; and thou hast praised the gods of silver , and gold , of brass , iron , wood , and stone , which see not , nor hear , nor know : and the God in whose hand thy breath is , and whose are all thy ways , hast thou not glorified : 5 : 24 Then was the part of the hand sent from him ; and this writing was written . 5 : 25 And this is the writing that was written , MENE , MENE , TEKEL , UPHARSIN . 5 : 26 This is the interpretation of the thing : MENE ; God hath numbered thy kingdom , and finished it . 5 : 27 TEKEL ; Thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting . 5 : 28 PERES ; Thy kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians . 5 : 29	l
2 And over these three presidents ; of whom Daniel was first : that the princes might give accounts unto them , and the king should have no damage . 6 : 3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm . 6 : 4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom ; but they could find none occasion nor fault ; forasmuch as he was faithful , neither was there any error or fault found in him . 6 : 5 Then said these men , We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his God . 6 : 6 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king , and said thus unto him , King Darius , live for ever . 6 : 7 All the presidents of the kingdom , the governors , and the princes , the counsellors , and the captains , have consulted together to establish a royal statute , and	l
snow , and the hair of his head like the pure wool : his throne was like the fiery flame , and his wheels as burning fire . 7 : 10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened . 7 : 11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake : I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame . 7 : 12 As concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time . 7 : 13 I saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of days , and they brought him near before him . 7 : 14 And there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all	l
I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Shushan in the palace , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of Ulai . 8 : 3 Then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .	s
16 And I heard a man ' s voice between the banks of Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision . 8 : 17 So he came near where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid , and fell upon my face : but he said unto me , Understand , O son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision . 8 : 18 Now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sleep on	s
the holy people . 8 : 25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand . 8 : 26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true : wherefore shut thou up the vision ; for it shall be for many days . 8 : 27 And I Daniel fainted , and was	s
shall be built again , and the wall , even in troublous times . 9 : 26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off , but not for himself : and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary ; and the end thereof shall be with a flood , and unto the end of the war desolations are determined . 9 : 27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week : and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and	s
and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength . 10 : 9 Yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward the ground . 10 : 10 And , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands . 10 : 11 And he said unto me , O Daniel , a man greatly beloved , understand the words that I speak unto thee , and stand upright : for unto thee am I now sent . And when he had spoken this word unto me , I stood trembling . 10 : 12 Then said he unto me , Fear not , Daniel : for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand , and to chasten thyself before thy God , thy words were heard , and I am come for thy words . 10 : 13 But the prince of the kingdom	l
richer than they all : and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia . 11 : 3 And a mighty king shall stand up , that shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will . 11 : 4 And when he shall stand up , his kingdom shall be broken , and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven ; and not to his posterity , nor according to his dominion which he ruled : for his kingdom shall be plucked up , even for others beside those . 11 : 5 And the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion . 11 : 6 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together ; for the king ' s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement : but she shall not retain the power of the arm ; neither shall he stand , nor his arm :	l
silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north . 11 : 9 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom , and shall return into his own land . 11 : 10 But his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces : and one shall certainly come , and overflow , and pass through : then shall he return , and be stirred up , even to his fortress . 11 : 11 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multitude ; but the multitude shall be given into his hand . 11 : 12 And when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it . 11 : 13 For the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former ,	l
and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches . 11 : 14 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall . 11 : 15 So the king of the north shall come , and cast up a mount , and take the most fenced cities : and the arms of the south shall not withstand , neither his chosen people , neither shall there be any strength	s
the end : because it is yet for a time appointed . 11 : 36 And the king shall do according to his will ; and he shall exalt himself , and magnify himself above every god , and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods , and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished : for that that is determined shall be done . 11 : 37 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god : for he shall magnify himself above all . 11	s
: 38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces : and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and pleasant things . 11 : 39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god , whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory : and he shall cause them to rule over many , and shall divide the land for gain . 11 : 40 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him : and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind , with chariots , and with horsemen , and with many ships ; and he shall enter into the countries , and shall overflow and pass over . 11 : 41 He shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon . 11 : 42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the	l
and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river . 12 : 6 And one said to the man clothed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ? 12 : 7 And I heard the man clothed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , when he held up his right hand and his left hand	s
unto heaven , and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time , times , and an half ; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people , all these things shall be finished . 12 : 8 And I heard , but I understood not : then said I , O my Lord , what shall be the end of these things ? 12 : 9 And he said , Go thy way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end . 12 : 10 Many shall be purified , and made white , and tried ; but the wicked shall do wickedly : and none of the wicked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand . 12 : 11 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days . 12 : 12 Blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days . 12 :	l
by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen . 1 : 8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah , she conceived , and bare a son . 1 : 9 Then said God , Call his name Loammi : for ye are not my people , and I will not be your God . 1 : 10 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea , which cannot be measured nor numbered ; and it shall come to pass , that in the	s
3 I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me : for now , O Ephraim , thou committest whoredom , and Israel is defiled . 5 : 4 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God : for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the LORD . 5 : 5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity : Judah also shall fall with them . 5 : 6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD ; but they shall not find him ; he hath withdrawn himself from them . 5 : 7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD : for they have begotten strange children : now shall a month devour them with their portions . 5 : 8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah : cry aloud at Bethaven , after thee , O Benjamin . 5 : 9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of Israel have	l
I made known that which shall surely be . 5 : 10 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water . 5 : 11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment , because he willingly walked after the commandment . 5 : 12 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of Judah as rottenness . 5 : 13 When Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah saw his wound , then went Ephraim to the Assyrian , and	s
the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces . 8 : 7 For they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it hath no stalk ; the bud shall yield no meal : if so be it yield , the strangers shall swallow it up . 8 : 8 Israel is swallowed up : now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure . 8 : 9 For they are gone up to Assyria , a wild ass alone by himself : Ephraim hath hired lovers . 8 :	s
Their heart is divided ; now shall they be found faulty : he shall break down their altars , he shall spoil their images . 10 : 3 For now they shall say , We have no king , because we feared not the LORD ; what then should a king do to us ? 10 : 4 They have spoken words , swearing falsely in making a covenant : thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field . 10 : 5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven : for	s
to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which I sent among you . 2 : 26 And ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the LORD your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed . 2 : 27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the LORD your God , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed . 2 : 28 And it shall come to pass afterward , that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions : 2 : 29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit . 2 : 30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke . 2	l
, I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron : 1 : 4 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael , which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad . 1 : 5 I will break also the bar of Damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven , and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden : and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir , saith the LORD . 1 : 6 Thus saith	s
the law of the LORD , and have not kept his commandments , and their lies caused them to err , after the which their fathers have walked : 2 : 5 But I will send a fire upon Judah , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem . 2 : 6 Thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ; 2 : 7 That pant after	s
; there is none to raise her up . 5 : 3 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel . 5 : 4 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel , Seek ye me , and ye shall live : 5 : 5 But seek not Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal , and pass not to Beersheba : for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity ,	s
That we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ; yea , and sell the refuse of the wheat ? 8 : 7 The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob , Surely I will never forget any of their works . 8 : 8 Shall not the land tremble for this , and every one mourn that dwelleth therein ? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and drowned , as by the flood of Egypt . 8 : 9 And	s
it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord GOD , that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day : 8 : 10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning , and all your songs into lamentation ; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins , and baldness upon every head ; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son , and the end thereof as a bitter day . 8 : 11 Behold , the days come , saith the Lord GOD , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the LORD : 8 : 12 And they shall wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east , they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD , and shall not find it . 8 : 13 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst . 8 : 14	l
They that swear by the sin of Samaria , and say , Thy god , O Dan , liveth ; and , The manner of Beersheba liveth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again . 9 : 1 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar : and he said , Smite the lintel of the door , that the posts may shake : and cut them in the head , all of them ; and I will slay the last of them with the sword : he that fleeth of them shall not flee away	s
, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth ; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob , saith the LORD . 9 : 9 For , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth . 9 : 10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword , which say , The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us . 9 : 11 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old : 9 : 12 That they may possess the remnant of Edom , and of all the heathen , which are called by my name , saith the LORD that doeth this . 9 : 13 Behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that the plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the	l
which I have given them , saith the LORD thy God . Obadiah 1 : 1 The vision of Obadiah . Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom ; We have heard a rumour from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent among the heathen , Arise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle . 1 : 2 Behold , I have made thee small among the heathen : thou art greatly despised . 1 : 3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee , thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high ; that saith in his heart , Who shall bring me down to the ground ? 1 : 4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle , and though thou set thy nest among the stars , thence will I bring thee down , saith the LORD . 1 : 5 If thieves came to thee , if robbers by night , ( how art thou cut off !) would they not have stolen till they had enough ? if the grapegatherers came to thee , would they not leave some grapes ? 1 :	l
laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ; 1 : 14 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway , to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress . 1 : 15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy reward shall return upon thine own head . 1 : 16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy	s
mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been . 1 : 17 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance , and there shall be holiness ; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions . 1 : 18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble , and they shall kindle in them , and devour them ; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau ; for the LORD hath spoken it . 1 : 19 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau ; and they of the plain the Philistines : and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim , and the fields of Samaria : and Benjamin shall possess Gilead . 1 : 20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites , even unto Zarephath ; and the captivity of Jerusalem , which is in Sepharad ,	l
holy temple . 2 : 8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy . 2 : 9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ; I will pay that that I have vowed . Salvation is of the LORD . 2 : 10 And the LORD spake unto the fish , and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land . 3 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time , saying , 3 : 2 Arise , go unto Nineveh , that great city , and preach	s
did it not . 4 : 1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly , and he was very angry . 4 : 2 And he prayed unto the LORD , and said , I pray thee , O LORD , was not this my saying , when I was yet in my country ? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish : for I knew that thou art a gracious God , and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repentest thee of the evil . 4 : 3 Therefore now , O LORD , take , I beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live . 4 : 4 Then said the LORD , Doest thou well to be angry ? 4 : 5 So Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city . 4 : 6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up	l
, It is better for me to die than to live . 4 : 9 And God said to Jonah , Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? And he said , I do well to be angry , even unto death . 4 : 10 Then said the LORD , Thou hast had pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night : 4 : 11 And should not I spare Nineveh , that great city , wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much cattle ? Micah 1 : 1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem . 1 : 2 Hear , all ye people ; hearken , O earth , and all that therein is : and let the Lord GOD be witness against you , the LORD from his holy temple	l
up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more . 4 : 4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it . 4 : 5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever . 4 : 6 In that day , saith the LORD , will I assemble her that halteth , and I will gather her that is driven out , and her that I have afflicted ; 4 : 7 And I will make her that halted a remnant , and her that was cast far off a strong nation : and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth , even for ever . 4 : 8 And thou , O tower of the flock , the strong hold of the daughter of Zion , unto thee shall it come , even the first dominion ; the kingdom shall come to the daughter	l
from the hand of thine enemies . 4 : 11 Now also many nations are gathered against thee , that say , Let her be defiled , and let our eye look upon Zion . 4 : 12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD , neither understand they his counsel : for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor . 4 : 13 Arise and thresh , O daughter of Zion : for I will make thine horn iron , and I will make thy hoofs brass : and thou shalt beat in pieces many people : and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD , and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth . 5 : 1 Now gather thyself in troops , O daughter of troops : he hath laid siege against us : they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek . 5 : 2 But thou , Bethlehem Ephratah , though thou be little among the thousands of Judah , yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel ; whose goings forth have	l
my firstborn for my transgression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ? 6 : 8 He hath shewed thee , O man , what is good ; and what doth the LORD require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy God ? 6 : 9 The LORD ' s voice crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom shall see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it . 6 : 10 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure that is abominable ? 6 : 11 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances , and with the bag of deceitful weights ? 6 : 12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth . 6 : 13 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee , in making thee desolate because of thy sins . 6 : 14 Thou shalt eat ,	l
them that dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings . 7 : 14 Feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of thine heritage , which dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of Carmel : let them feed in Bashan and Gilead , as in the days of old . 7 : 15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things . 7 : 16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand	s
upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf . 7 : 17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent , they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth : they shall be afraid of the LORD our God , and shall fear because of thee . 7 : 18 Who is a God like unto thee , that pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? he retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy . 7 : 19 He will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea . 7 : 20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob , and the mercy to Abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old . Nahum 1 : 1 The burden of Nineveh . The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite . 1 : 2 God is jealous , and the LORD revengeth ; the LORD revengeth , and is furious ; the LORD will	l
molten image : I will make thy grave ; for thou art vile . 1 : 15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ! O Judah , keep thy solemn feasts , perform thy vows : for the wicked shall no more pass through thee ; he is utterly cut off . 2 : 1 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face : keep the munition , watch the way , make thy loins strong , fortify thy power mightily . 2 : 2 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel : for the emptiers have emptied them out , and marred their vine branches . 2 : 3 The shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken . 2 : 4 The chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall justle one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like torches ,	l
, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy . 3 : 12 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater . 3 : 13 Behold , thy people in the midst of thee are women : the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies : the fire shall devour thy bars . 3 : 14 Draw thee waters for the siege , fortify thy strong holds : go into clay , and tread the morter , make strong the brickkiln . 3 : 15 There shall the fire devour thee ; the sword shall cut thee off , it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm : make thyself many as the cankerworm , make thyself many as the locusts . 3 : 16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven : the cankerworm spoileth , and fleeth away . 3 : 17 Thy crowned are as the locusts , and thy captains as the great grasshoppers , which camp in the hedges in the cold day , but	l
, ye shall be slain by my sword . 2 : 13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north , and destroy Assyria ; and will make Nineveh a desolation , and dry like a wilderness . 2 : 14 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her , all the beasts of the nations : both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it ; their voice shall sing in the windows ; desolation shall be in the thresholds ; for he shall uncover the cedar work . 2 : 15 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly , that said in her heart , I am , and there is none beside me : how is she become a desolation , a place for beasts to lie down in ! every one that passeth by her shall hiss , and wag his hand . 3 : 1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted , to the oppressing city ! 3 : 2 She obeyed not the voice ; she received not correction ; she trusted not in the LORD ; she drew not near to	l
: and in this place will I give peace , saith the LORD of hosts . 2 : 10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet , saying , 2 : 11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Ask now the priests concerning the law , saying , 2 : 12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment , and with his skirt do touch bread , or pottage , or wine , or oil , or any meat , shall it be holy ? And the priests answered and said , No . 2 : 13 Then said Haggai , If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these , shall it be unclean ? And the priests answered and said , It shall be unclean . 2 : 14 Then answered Haggai , and said , So is this people , and so is this nation before me , saith the LORD ; and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there	l
. 1 : 15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease : for I was but a little displeased , and they helped forward the affliction . 1 : 16 Therefore thus saith the LORD ; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies : my house shall be built in it , saith the LORD of hosts , and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem . 1 : 17 Cry yet , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad ; and	s
the LORD shall yet comfort Zion , and shall yet choose Jerusalem . 1 : 18 Then lifted I up mine eyes , and saw , and behold four horns . 1 : 19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me , What be these ? And he answered me , These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem . 1 : 20 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters . 1 : 21 Then said I , What come these to do ? And he spake , saying , These are the horns which have scattered Judah , so that no man did lift up his head : but these are come to fray them , to cast out the horns of the Gentiles , which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it . 2 : 1 I lifted up mine eyes again , and looked , and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand . 2 : 2 Then said I , Whither goest thou ? And he said unto me , To measure Jerusalem , to see what is the breadth	l
. 2 : 6 Ho , ho , come forth , and flee from the land of the north , saith the LORD : for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven , saith the LORD . 2 : 7 Deliver thyself , O Zion , that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon . 2 : 8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye . 2 : 9 For , behold , I will shake mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants : and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me . 2 : 10 Sing and rejoice , O daughter of Zion : for , lo , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , saith the LORD . 2 : 11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and	l
, The LORD rebuke thee , O Satan ; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee : is not this a brand plucked out of the fire ? 3 : 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments , and stood before the angel . 3 : 4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the filthy garments from him . And unto him he said , Behold , I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee , and I will clothe thee with change of raiment . 3 : 5 And I said , Let them set a fair mitre upon his head . So they set a fair mitre upon his head , and clothed him with garments . And the angel of the LORD stood by . 3 : 6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua , saying , 3 : 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; If thou wilt walk in my ways , and if thou wilt keep my charge , then thou shalt also judge my house , and shalt also keep my courts , and I	l
of the ephah ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof . 5 : 9 Then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; for they had wings like the wings of a stork : and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven . 5 : 10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me , Whither do these bear the ephah ? 5 : 11 And he said unto me	s
2 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech , and their men , to pray before the LORD , 7 : 3 And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts , and to the prophets , saying , Should I weep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done these so many years ? 7 : 4 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me , saying , 7 : 5 Speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ? 7 : 6 And when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ? 7 : 7 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and the cities thereof round about her , when men	l
their ears , that they should not hear . 7 : 12 Yea , they made their hearts as an adamant stone , lest they should hear the law , and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets : therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts . 7 : 13 Therefore it is come to pass , that as he cried , and they would not hear ; so they cried , and I would not hear , saith the LORD of hosts : 7 : 14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not . Thus the land was desolate after them , that no man passed through nor returned : for they laid the pleasant land desolate . 8 : 1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me , saying , 8 : 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I was jealous for her with great fury . 8 : 3 Thus saith the LORD ; I am returned unto Zion , and	l
If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days , should it also be marvellous in mine eyes ? saith the LORD of hosts . 8 : 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Behold , I will save my people from the east country , and from the west country ; 8 : 8 And I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness . 8 : 9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Let your hands be strong , ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets , which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid , that the temple might be built . 8 : 10 For before these days there was no hire for man , nor any hire for beast ; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction : for I set all men every	l
to seek the LORD of hosts : I will go also . 8 : 22 Yea , many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem , and to pray before the LORD . 8 : 23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; In those days it shall come to pass , that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations , even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew , saying , We will go with you : for we have heard that God is with you . 9 : 1 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach , and Damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eyes of man , as of all the tribes of Israel , shall be toward the LORD . 9 : 2 And Hamath also shall border thereby ; Tyrus , and Zidon , though it be very wise . 9 : 3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold , and heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets	l
. 9 : 4 Behold , the LORD will cast her out , and he will smite her power in the sea ; and she shall be devoured with fire . 9 : 5 Ashkelon shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sorrowful , and Ekron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited . 9 : 6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .	s
forbear . So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver . 11 : 13 And the LORD said unto me , Cast it unto the potter : a goodly price that I was prised at of them . And I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD . 11 : 14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff , even Bands , that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel . 11 : 15 And the LORD said unto me , Take unto thee	s
I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it . 12 : 4 In that day , saith the LORD , I will smite every horse with astonishment , and his rider with madness : and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah , and will smite every horse of the people with blindness . 12 : 5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of	s
the LORD of hosts , neither will I accept an offering at your hand . 1 : 11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles ; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name , and a pure offering : for my name shall be great among the heathen , saith the LORD of hosts . 1 : 12 But ye have profaned it , in that ye say , The table of the LORD is polluted ; and the fruit thereof , even his meat , is contemptible . 1 : 13 Ye said also , Behold , what a weariness is it ! and ye have snuffed at it , saith the LORD of hosts ; and ye brought that which was torn , and the lame , and the sick ; thus ye brought an offering : should I accept this of your hand ? saith the LORD . 1 : 14 But cursed be the deceiver , which hath in his flock a male , and voweth , and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing :	l
of judgment ? 3 : 1 Behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the LORD , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to his temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the LORD of hosts . 3 : 2 But who may abide the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he is like a refiner ' s fire , and like fullers ' soap : 3 : 3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver : and he shall purify the sons of Levi , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness . 3 : 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD , as in the days of old , and as in former years . 3 : 5 And I will come near to you to judgment ; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers , and against the	l
shall go forth , and grow up as calves of the stall . 4 : 3 And ye shall tread down the wicked ; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this , saith the LORD of hosts . 4 : 4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant , which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel , with the statutes and judgments . 4 : 5 Behold , I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day	s
13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ; 1 : 14 And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ; 1 : 15 And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ; 1 : 16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ . 1 : 17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations . 1 : 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost . 1 : 19 Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily . 1 : 20 But while he thought on these things , behold , the	l
angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost . 1 : 21 And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins . 1 : 22 Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , 1 :	s
Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also . 2 : 9 When they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was . 2 : 10 When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy . 2 : 11 And when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense and myrrh . 2 : 12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way . 2 : 13 And when they were departed , behold , the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise , and take the young child	l
ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . 3 : 3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . 3 : 4 And the same John had his raiment of camel ' s hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey . 3 : 5 Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about Jordan , 3 : 6 And were baptized of him in Jordan , confessing their sins . 3 : 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? 3 : 8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance : 3 : 9 And think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able	l
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred . 4 : 3 And when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread . 4 : 4 But he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God . 4 : 5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a	s
Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ; 4 : 13 And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim : 4 : 14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying , 4 : 15 The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ; 4 : 16 The people which sat in darkness	s
beyond Jordan . 5 : 1 And seeing the multitudes , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him : 5 : 2 And he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying , 5 : 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . 5 : 4 Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted . 5 : 5 Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth . 5 : 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled . 5 : 7 Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy . 5 : 8 Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God . 5 : 9 Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God . 5 : 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . 5 : 11 Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you ,	l
and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake . 5 : 12 Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you . 5 : 13 Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men . 5 : 14 Ye are the light of	s
, Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement : 5 : 32 But I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery . 5 : 33 Again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths : 5 : 34 But I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God ' s throne : 5 : 35 Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King . 5 : 36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black . 5 : 37 But let your communication be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil . 5 : 38 Ye have	l
heard that it hath been said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth : 5 : 39 But I say unto you , That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . 5 : 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also . 5 : 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain . 5 : 42	s
is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light . 6 : 23 But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness ! 6 : 24 No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye cannot serve God and mammon .	s
darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . 8 : 13 And Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour . 8 : 14 And when Jesus was come into Peter ' s house , he saw his wife ' s mother laid , and sick of a fever . 8 : 15 And he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them . 8 : 16 When the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick : 8 : 17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities , and bare our sicknesses . 8 : 18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side . 8 : 19 And a certain scribe came , and said unto	l
into a ship , his disciples followed him . 8 : 24 And , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep . 8 : 25 And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish . 8 : 26 And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm . 8 : 27 But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ! 8 : 28 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way . 8 : 29 And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou	l
into an house , salute it . 10 : 13 And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you . 10 : 14 And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet . 10 : 15 Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city . 10 : 16 Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves . 10 : 17 But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ; 10 : 18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles . 10 : 19 But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what	l
that endureth to the end shall be saved . 10 : 23 But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come . 10 : 24 The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord . 10 : 25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ? 10 : 26 Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known . 10 : 27 What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops . 10 : 28 And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him	l
is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he . 11 : 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force . 11 : 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John . 11 : 14 And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come . 11 : 15 He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . 11 : 16 But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows , 11 : 17 And saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented . 11 : 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a devil . 11 : 19 The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . But wisdom is	l
for you . 11 : 23 And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day . 11 : 24 But I say unto you , That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee . 11 : 25 At that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes . 11 : 26 Even so , Father : for so it seemed good in thy sight . 11 : 27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him . 11 : 28 Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy	l
he went into their synagogue : 12 : 10 And , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him . 12 : 11 And he said unto them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ? 12 : 12 How much then	s
they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils . 12 : 25 And Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand : 12 : 26 And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ? 12 : 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your judges . 12 : 28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you . 12 : 29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man ' s house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house . 12 : 30 He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad . 12 : 31 Wherefore I say unto	l
to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here . 12 : 43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none . 12 : 44 Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished . 12 : 45 Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation . 12 : 46 While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him . 12 : 47 Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee . 12 : 48 But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my	l
which was sown in his heart . This is he which received seed by the way side . 13 : 20 But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ; 13 : 21 Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended . 13 : 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ;	s
13 : 37 He answered and said unto them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ; 13 : 38 The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ; 13 : 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels . 13 : 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in	s
him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals . 14 : 16 But Jesus said unto them , They need not depart ; give ye them to eat . 14 : 17 And they say unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes . 14 : 18 He said , Bring them hither to me . 14 : 19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude . 14 : 20 And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full . 14 : 21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children . 14 : 22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship ,	l
But in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men . 15 : 10 And he called the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand : 15 : 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man . 15 : 12 Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ? 15 : 13 But he answered and said , Every	s
side , they had forgotten to take bread . 16 : 6 Then Jesus said unto them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees . 16 : 7 And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have taken no bread . 16 : 8 Which when Jesus perceived , he said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ? 16 : 9 Do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? 16 : 10 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? 16 : 11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees ? 16 : 12 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees . 16	l
his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it . 16 : 26 For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? 16 : 27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works . 16 : 28 Verily I say unto you , There be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . 17 : 1 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter , James , and John his brother , and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart , 17 : 2 And was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light . 17 : 3 And , behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him . 17 : 4 Then answered Peter	l
tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him . 18 : 35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses . 19 : 1 And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan ; 19 : 2 And great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there . 19 : 3 The Pharisees also came unto him , tempting him	s
his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . 19 : 29 And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name ' s sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life . 19 : 30 But many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first . 20 : 1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man	s
to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again . 20 : 20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him . 20 : 21 And he said unto her , What wilt thou ? She saith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom . 20 : 22 But Jesus answered and said , Ye know	s
his merchandise : 22 : 6 And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them . 22 : 7 But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city . 22 : 8 Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy . 22 : 9 Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage	s
. 24 : 1 And Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple . 24 : 2 And Jesus said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . 24 : 3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things	s
, Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out . 25 : 9 But the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves . 25 : 10 And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut . 25 : 11 Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord ,	s
unto you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven . 26 : 65 Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy . 26 : 66 What think ye ? They answered and said , He is guilty of death . 26 : 67 Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with	s
the palms of their hands , 26 : 68 Saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ , Who is he that smote thee ? 26 : 69 Now Peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee . 26 : 70 But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest . 26 : 71 And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth . 26 : 72 And again he denied with an oath , I do not know the man . 26 : 73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee . 26 : 74 Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew . 26 : 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him	l
, His blood be on us , and on our children . 27 : 26 Then released he Barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified . 27 : 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers . 27 : 28 And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe . 27 : 29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews ! 27 : 30 And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head . 27 : 31 And after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him . 27 : 32 And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon	l
by name : him they compelled to bear his cross . 27 : 33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull , 27 : 34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink . 27 : 35 And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture	s
44 The thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth . 27 : 45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour . 27 : 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? 27 : 47 Some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for	s
sure as ye can . 27 : 66 So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch . 28 : 1 In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre . 28 : 2 And , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it	s
Then said Jesus unto them , Be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee , and there shall they see me . 28 : 11 Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done . 28 : 12 And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers , 28 : 13 Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and	s
, and he taught them . 2 : 14 And as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him . 2 : 15 And it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him . 2 : 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ? 2 : 17 When Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . 2 : 18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him , Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees	l
a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples . 4 : 35 And the same day , when the even was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side . 4 : 36 And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . And there were also with him other little ships . 4 : 37 And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full . 4 : 38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ? 4 : 39 And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . 4 : 40 And he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is	l
send them away out of the country . 5 : 11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding . 5 : 12 And all the devils besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them . 5 : 13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ;) and were choked in the sea	s
yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue ' s house certain which said , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ? 5 : 36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe . 5 : 37 And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James . 5 : 38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly . 5 : 39 And when he was come in , he saith unto them , Why make ye this ado , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth . 5 : 40 And they laughed him to scorn . But when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying . 5 : 41 And he took	l
place . 6 : 11 And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them . Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city . 6 : 12 And they went out , and preached that men should repent . 6 : 13 And they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them . 6 : 14 And king Herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad :) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him . 6 : 15 Others said , That it is Elias . And others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets . 6 : 16 But when Herod heard thereof , he said , It is John , whom I beheaded : he is risen from the dead . 6 : 17 For	l
Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip ' s wife : for he had married her . 6 : 18 For John had said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ' s wife . 6 : 19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not : 6 : 20 For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and	s
when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes . 6 : 39 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass . 6 : 40 And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties . 6 : 41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all . 6 : 42 And they did all eat , and were filled . 6 : 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes . 6 : 44 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men . 6 : 45 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people . 6 : 46 And when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray	l
. 6 : 47 And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land . 6 : 48 And he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them . 6 : 49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out : 6 : 50 For	s
some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power . 9 : 2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them . 9 : 3 And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them . 9 : 4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus . 9 : 5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias . 9 : 6 For he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid . 9 : 7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him . 9	l
: 8 And suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves . 9 : 9 And as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead . 9 : 10 And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean . 9 : 11 And they asked him , saying , Why say the	s
up ; and he arose . 9 : 28 And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ? 9 : 29 And he said unto them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting . 9 : 30 And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it . 9 : 31 For he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into	s
he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again . 10 : 2 And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him . 10 : 3 And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ? 10 : 4 And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away . 10 : 5 And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept . 10 : 6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female . 10 : 7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ; 10 : 8 And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh . 10 : 9 What therefore God hath joined together	l
about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! 10 : 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! 10 : 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . 10 : 26 And they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ? 10 : 27 And Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible . 10 : 28 Then Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee . 10 : 29 And Jesus answered and said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father	l
left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared . 10 : 41 And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John . 10 : 42 But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them . 10 : 43 But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister : 10 : 44 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all . 10 : 45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . 10 : 46 And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging . 10 : 47	l
1 And he began to speak unto them by parables . A certain man planted a vineyard , and set an hedge about it , and digged a place for the winefat , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country . 12 : 2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard . 12 : 3 And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty . 12	s
: 4 And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled . 12 : 5 And again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some . 12 : 6 Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son . 12 : 7 But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be our ' s . 12 : 8 And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard . 12 : 9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . 12 : 10 And have ye not read this scripture ; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner : 12 : 11 This was the Lord ' s doing	l
for there is one God ; and there is none other but he : 12 : 33 And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . 12 : 34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question . 12 : 35 And Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David ? 12 : 36 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The LORD said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool . 12 : 37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord ; and whence is he then his son ? And the common people heard him gladly . 12 : 38 And he said unto them in his doctrine ,	l
, after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , 13 : 25 And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken . 13 : 26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory . 13 : 27 And then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .	s
14 : 2 But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people . 14 : 3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head . 14 : 4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , Why was this waste of the ointment made ? 14 : 5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her . 14 : 6 And Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me . 14 : 7 For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always . 14 : 8 She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the	l
And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words . 14 : 40 And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy ,) neither wist they what to answer him . 14 : 41 And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . 14 : 42 Rise up , let us go	s
, to be crucified . 15 : 16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band . 15 : 17 And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head , 15 : 18 And began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews ! 15 : 19 And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him . 15 : 20 And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him . 15 : 21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross . 15 : 22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull . 15 : 23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh	l
: but he received it not . 15 : 24 And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take . 15 : 25 And it was the third hour , and they crucified him . 15 : 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over , THE KING OF THE JEWS . 15 : 27 And with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left . 15 : 28 And the scripture was fulfilled	s
, he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God . 16 : 20 And they went forth , and preached every where , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen . The Gospel According to Saint Luke 1 : 1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us , 1 : 2 Even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers	s
temple of the Lord . 1 : 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense . 1 : 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense . 1 : 12 And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him . 1 : 13 But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou	s
his kingdom there shall be no end . 1 : 34 Then said Mary unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ? 1 : 35 And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God . 1 : 36 And , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren . 1 : 37 For with God nothing shall be impossible . 1 : 38 And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her . 1 : 39 And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ; 1 : 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth . 1 : 41 And	l
the Lord was with him . 1 : 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying , 1 : 68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people , 1 : 69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ; 1 : 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began : 1 : 71 That we should be saved from our enemies ,	s
city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David :) 2 : 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child . 2 : 6 And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered . 2 : 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn . 2 : 8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night . 2 : 9 And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid . 2 : 10 And the angel said unto them , Fear not : for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people . 2 : 11 For unto you is born this day in	l
: 4 : 10 For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee : 4 : 11 And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone . 4 : 12 And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . 4 : 13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season . 4 : 14 And Jesus returned in the power	s
come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art ; the Holy One of God . 4 : 35 And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not . 4 : 36 And they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out . 4 : 37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about . 4 : 38 And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon ' s house . And Simon ' s wife ' s mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her . 4 : 39 And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them . 4 : 40 Now when the sun was setting , all they that had	l
saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord . 5 : 9 For he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken : 5 : 10 And so was also James , and John , the sons of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men . 5 : 11 And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him . 5 : 12 And it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing Jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . 5 : 13 And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him . 5 : 14 And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew	l
which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them . 5 : 18 And , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him . 5 : 19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus . 5 : 20 And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee . 5 : 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? 5 : 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , What reason ye in your hearts ? 5 : 23 Whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven	l
thine eat and drink ? 5 : 34 And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? 5 : 35 But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days . 5 : 36 And he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was	s
it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again . 6 : 39 And he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ? 6 : 40 The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master . 6 : 41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? 6 : 42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye . 6	l
his mouth speaketh . 6 : 46 And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? 6 : 47 Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like : 6 : 48 He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock . 6 : 49 But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great . 7 : 1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum . 7 : 2 And a certain centurion ' s servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready	l
nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a devil . 7 : 34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners ! 7 : 35 But wisdom is justified of all her children . 7 : 36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisee ' s house , and sat down to meat . 7 : 37 And , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee ' s house , brought an alabaster box of ointment , 7 : 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment . 7 : 39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if	l
8 : 27 And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs . 8 : 28 When he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I beseech thee , torment me not . 8 : 29 ( For he	s
he went up into the ship , and returned back again . 8 : 38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying , 8 : 39 Return to thine own house , and shew how great things God hath done unto thee . And he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him . 8 : 40 And it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him . 8 : 41 And , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house : 8 : 42 For he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . But as he went the people thronged him . 8 : 43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years	l
them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing . 9 : 12 And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place . 9 : 13 But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people . 9 : 14 For they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down by fifties in a company . 9 : 15 And they did so , and made them all sit down . 9 : 16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude . 9 : 17 And they did	l
teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him . 9 : 40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not . 9 : 41 And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither . 9 : 42 And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father . 9 : 43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples , 9 : 44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men . 9 : 45 But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying . 9 :	l
men ' s lives , but to save them . And they went to another village . 9 : 57 And it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . 9 : 58 And Jesus said unto him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . 9 : 59 And he said unto another , Follow me . But he	s
shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you . 10 : 15 And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell . 10 : 16 He that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me . 10 : 17 And the seventy returned again with joy , saying , Lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name . 10 : 18 And he said unto them	s
; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet . 11 : 30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation . 11 : 31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here . 11 : 32 The	s
yet I say unto you , that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . 12 : 28 If then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ? 12 : 29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind . 12 : 30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things . 12 : 31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you . 12 : 32 Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father ' s good pleasure to give you the kingdom . 12 : 33 Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth . 12	l
to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them . 12 : 38 And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants . 12 : 39 And this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through . 12 : 40 Be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not . 12 : 41 Then Peter said unto him , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ? 12 : 42 And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ? 12 : 43 Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing . 12 : 44 Of a truth I say unto you , that he will	l
make him ruler over all that he hath . 12 : 45 But and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ; 12 : 46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers . 12 : 47 And	s
that servant , which knew his lord ' s will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes . 12 : 48 But he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more . 12 : 49 I am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will I , if it be already kindled ? 12 : 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished ! 12 : 51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division : 12 : 52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three . 12 : 53 The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the	l
But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee . 14 : 11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted . 14 : 12 Then said he also to him that bade him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee . 14 : 13 But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind : 14 : 14 And thou shalt be blessed ; for they cannot recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just . 14 : 15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed	l
is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God . 14 : 16 Then said he unto him , A certain man made a great supper , and bade many : 14 : 17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for all things are now ready . 14 : 18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee	s
, let him hear . 15 : 1 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him . 15 : 2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them . 15 : 3 And he spake this parable unto them , saying , 15 : 4 What man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find	s
: 15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine . 15 : 16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him . 15 : 17 And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father ' s have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger ! 15 : 18 I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee , 15 : 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants . 15 : 20 And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him . 15 : 21 And the son said unto him , Father , I have	l
sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son . 15 : 22 But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet : 15 : 23 And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry : 15 : 24 For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and	s
him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward . 16 : 3 Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I cannot dig ; to beg I am ashamed . 16 : 4 I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses . 16 : 5 So he called every one of his lord ' s debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ? 16 : 6 And he said , An hundred measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty . 16 : 7 Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , An hundred measures of wheat . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore . 16 : 8 And the lord commended	l
law to fail . 16 : 18 Whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery . 16 : 19 There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day : 16 : 20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores , 16 : 21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man '	s
from thence . 16 : 27 Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ' s house : 16 : 28 For I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment . 16 : 29 Abraham saith unto him , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them . 16 : 30 And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent	s
it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed . 17 : 31 In that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back . 17 : 32 Remember Lot ' s wife . 17 : 33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it . 17 : 34 I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left . 17 : 35 Two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left . 17 : 36 Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left . 17 : 37 And they answered and said unto him , Where , Lord ? And he said unto them , Wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered	l
to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ; 19 : 38 Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . 19 : 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples . 19 : 40 And he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out . 19 : 41 And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it , 19 : 42 Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes . 19 : 43 For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side , 19 : 44 And shall lay thee even with the	l
held their peace . 20 : 27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him , 20 : 28 Saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man ' s brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . 20 : 29 There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children . 20 : 30 And	s
him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ? 23 : 41 And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss . 23 : 42 And he said unto Jesus , Lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom . 23 : 43 And Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , To day shalt thou be with me in paradise . 23 : 44 And it was about the sixth hour ,	s
, he shewed them his hands and his feet . 24 : 41 And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here any meat ? 24 : 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb . 24 : 43 And he took it , and did eat before them . 24 : 44 And he said unto them , These are the words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be	s
Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel . 1 : 50 Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these . 1 : 51 And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . 2 : 1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there : 2 : 2 And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage . 2 : 3 And when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine . 2 : 4 Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come . 2 : 5 His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it . 2 : 6	l
the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ; 2 : 16 And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father ' s house an house of merchandise . 2 : 17 And his disciples remembered that it was written , The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up . 2 : 18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ? 2 : 19 Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple ,	s
answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God . 3 : 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit . 3 : 7 Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born again . 3 : 8 The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit . 3 : 9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ? 3 : 10 Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ? 3 : 11 Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness . 3 : 12 If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe	l
also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized . 3 : 24 For John was not yet cast into prison . 3 : 25 Then there arose a question between some of John ' s disciples and the Jews about purifying . 3 : 26 And they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .	s
Judaea , and departed again into Galilee . 4 : 4 And he must needs go through Samaria . 4 : 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph . 4 : 6 Now Jacob ' s well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour . 4 : 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink . 4 : 8 ( For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat .) 4 : 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans . 4 : 10 Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ;	l
14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life . 4 : 15 The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw . 4 : 16 Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither . 4 : 17 The woman answered and said , I have no husband . Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband : 4 : 18 For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly . 4 : 19 The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet . 4 : 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship . 4 : 21 Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh	l
21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will . 5 : 22 For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son : 5 : 23 That all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him . 5 : 24 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me	s
, but the will of the Father which hath sent me . 5 : 31 If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . 5 : 32 There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true . 5 : 33 Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth . 5 : 34 But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved . 5 : 35 He was a burning	s
Father ' s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive . 5 : 44 How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ? 5 : 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust . 5 : 46 For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me ; for he wrote of	s
He gave them bread from heaven to eat . 6 : 32 Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven . 6 : 33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world . 6 : 34 Then said they unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread . 6 : 35 And Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst . 6 : 36 But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not . 6 : 37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out . 6 : 38 For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me . 6 : 39 And	l
This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die . 6 : 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world . 6 : 52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? 6 : 53 Then Jesus said	s
he would not walk in Jewry , because the Jews sought to kill him . 7 : 2 Now the Jew ' s feast of tabernacles was at hand . 7 : 3 His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest . 7 : 4 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world . 7 : 5 For	s
of the Jews . 7 : 14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught . 7 : 15 And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? 7 : 16 Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me . 7 : 17 If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself . 7 : 18	s
come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not . 7 : 29 But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me . 7 : 30 Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come . 7 : 31 And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ? 7 : 32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him . 7 : 33 Then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me . 7 : 34 Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye cannot come . 7 : 35 Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go	l
Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet . 7 : 53 And every man went unto his own house . 8 : 1 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives . 8 : 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them . 8 : 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst , 8 : 4 They say unto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act . 8 : 5 Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ? 8 : 6 This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not . 8 : 7 So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them ,	l
hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come . 8 : 21 Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye cannot come . 8 : 22 Then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye cannot come . 8 : 23 And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world . 8 : 24 I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins . 8 : 25 Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? And Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning . 8 : 26 I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those	l
not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God . 8 : 42 Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me . 8 : 43 Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word . 8 : 44 Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it . 8 : 45 And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not . 8 : 46 Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ? 8 : 47 He that is of God heareth God ' s words : ye therefore hear them not ,	l
: 41 Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth . 10 : 1 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber . 10 : 2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep . 10 : 3 To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep	s
hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out . 10 : 4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice . 10 : 5 And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers . 10 : 6 This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them . 10 : 7 Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep . 10 : 8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them . 10 : 9 I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture . 10 : 10 The thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I	l
am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly . 10 : 11 I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep . 10 : 12 But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep . 10 : 13 The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the	s
as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house . 11 : 21 Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . 11 : 22 But I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee . 11 : 23 Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again . 11 : 24 Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day . 11 : 25 Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : 11 : 26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . Believest thou this ? 11 : 27 She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world . 11 : 28 And when she had so said ,	l
this Son of man ? 12 : 35 Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth . 12 : 36 While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them . 12 : 37 But though he had done so many miracles before them ,	s
he that seeth me seeth him that sent me . 12 : 46 I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness . 12 : 47 And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world . 12 : 48 He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him	s
me afterwards . 13 : 37 Peter said unto him , Lord , why cannot I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake . 13 : 38 Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice . 14 : 1 Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me . 14 : 2 In my Father ' s house are many	s
mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you . 14 : 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also . 14 : 4 And whither I go ye know , and the way ye know . 14 : 5 Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ? 14 : 6 Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me . 14 : 7 If ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him . 14 : 8 Philip saith unto him , Lord , shew us the Father , and it sufficeth us . 14 : 9 Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast	l
Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ? 14 : 23 Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him . 14 : 24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father ' s which sent me . 14 : 25 These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you . 14 : 26 But the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you . 14 : 27 Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . 14 : 28 Ye have	l
prince of this world is judged . 16 : 12 I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye cannot bear them now . 16 : 13 Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come . 16 : 14 He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .	s
16 : 15 All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you . 16 : 16 A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father . 16 : 17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ? 16 : 18 They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we cannot tell what he saith . 16 : 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ? 16 : 20 Verily	l
the world . 17 : 25 O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me . 17 : 26 And I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them . 18 : 1 When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered ,	s
and his disciples . 18 : 2 And Judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples . 18 : 3 Judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons . 18 : 4 Jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon him , went forth , and said unto them , Whom seek ye ? 18 : 5 They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . And Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them . 18 : 6 As soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground . 18 : 7 Then asked he them again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth . 18 : 8 Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way : 18 : 9 That the saying might be	l
19 : 17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha : 19 : 18 Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst . 19 : 19 And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS . 19 : 20 This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was	s
, and Mary Magdalene . 19 : 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son ! 19 : 27 Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home . 19 : 28 After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst . 19 : 29 Now there was set a vessel	s
being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God : 1 : 4 And , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me . 1 : 5 For John truly baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence . 1 : 6 When they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , Lord , wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel ? 1 : 7 And he said unto them , It is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the Father hath put in his own power . 1 : 8 But ye shall receive power , after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Judaea , and in Samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth . 1 : 9 And when	l
he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight . 1 : 10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up , behold , two men stood by them in white apparel ; 1 : 11 Which also said , Ye men of Galilee , why stand ye gazing up into heaven ? this same Jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven . 1	s
: 12 And when Peter saw it , he answered unto the people , Ye men of Israel , why marvel ye at this ? or why look ye so earnestly on us , as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk ? 3 : 13 The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glorified his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pilate , when he was determined to let him go . 3 : 14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just , and desired a murderer to be granted unto you ; 3 : 15 And killed the Prince of life , whom God hath raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses . 3 : 16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : yea , the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all . 3 : 17 And now , brethren , I	l
wot that through ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers . 3 : 18 But those things , which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he hath so fulfilled . 3 : 19 Repent ye therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord . 3 : 20 And he shall send Jesus Christ , which before was preached unto you : 3 : 21 Whom the heaven	s
five thousand . 4 : 5 And it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes , 4 : 6 And Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem . 4 : 7 And when they had set them in the midst , they asked , By what power , or by what name , have ye done this ? 4 : 8 Then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of the people , and elders of Israel , 4 : 9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole ; 4 : 10 Be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom God raised from the dead , even by him doth this man stand here before you whole . 4 : 11	l
, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one . 5 : 17 Then the high priest rose up , and all they that were with him , ( which is the sect of the Sadducees ,) and were filled with indignation , 5 : 18 And laid their hands on the apostles , and put them in the common prison . 5 : 19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said , 5 : 20 Go , stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life . 5 : 21 And when they heard that , they entered into the temple early in the morning , and taught . But the high priest came , and they that were with him , and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of Israel , and sent to the prison to have them brought . 5 : 22 But when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned and told , 5 : 23	l
33 When they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to slay them . 5 : 34 Then stood there up one in the council , a Pharisee , named Gamaliel , a doctor of the law , had in reputation among all the people , and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ; 5 : 35 And said unto them , Ye men of Israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men . 5 : 36 For before these days rose up Theudas	s
rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name . 5 : 42 And daily in the temple , and in every house , they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ . 6 : 1 And in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration . 6 : 2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them , and said , It is not reason that we should	s
: 3 As for Saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison . 8 : 4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word . 8 : 5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ unto them . 8 : 6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did . 8 : 7 For unclean spirits , crying with loud	s
in his chariot read Esaias the prophet . 8 : 29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip , Go near , and join thyself to this chariot . 8 : 30 And Philip ran thither to him , and heard him read the prophet Esaias , and said , Understandest thou what thou readest ? 8 : 31 And he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him . 8 : 32 The place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth : 8 : 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth . 8 : 34 And the eunuch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ? 8 : 35 Then Philip opened his mouth , and began at the	l
And Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus . 9 : 9 And he was three days without sight , and neither did eat nor drink . 9 : 10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias . And he said , Behold , I am here , Lord . 9 : 11 And the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the street which is called Straight , and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul , of Tarsus : for , behold , he prayeth , 9 : 12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight . 9 : 13 Then Ananias answered , Lord , I have heard by many of this man , how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem : 9 : 14 And here he	l
him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus . 9 : 28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem . 9 : 29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him . 9 : 30 Which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus . 9 : 31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied . 9 : 32 And it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda . 9 : 33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and	l
believed in the Lord . 9 : 43 And it came to pass , that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner . 10 : 1 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius , a centurion of the band called the Italian band , 10 : 2 A devout man , and one that feared God with all his house , which gave much alms to the people , and prayed to God alway . 10 : 3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of	s
I was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house , and , behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing , 10 : 31 And said , Cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God . 10 : 32 Send therefore to Joppa , and call hither Simon , whose surname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto	s
unto him , Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ; 11 : 14 Who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved . 11 : 15 And as I began to speak , the Holy Ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning . 11 : 16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost . 11 : 17 Forasmuch then as	s
delivered me out of the hand of Herod , and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews . 12 : 12 And when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose surname was Mark ; where many were gathered together praying . 12 : 13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate , a damsel came to hearken , named Rhoda . 12 : 14 And when she knew Peter ' s voice , she opened not the gate for gladness , but	s
they sailed to Cyprus . 13 : 5 And when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister . 13 : 6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Barjesus : 13 : 7 Which was with the deputy of the country , Sergius Paulus , a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the	s
unto us their children , in that he hath raised up Jesus again ; as it is also written in the second psalm , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee . 13 : 34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , I will give you the sure mercies of David . 13 : 35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm , Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption . 13 : 36	s
up , many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of God . 13 : 44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God . 13 : 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming . 13 : 46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold , and said , It was necessary that	s
, they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren . 15 : 4 And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them . 15 : 5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed , saying , That it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses .	s
them after this manner ; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia . 15 : 24 Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment : 15 : 25 It seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and	s
suffered them not . 16 : 8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas . 16 : 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia , and help us . 16 : 10 And after he had seen the vision , immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia , assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them . 16 : 11 Therefore loosing from Troas , we came with a straight course to Samothracia , and the next day to Neapolis ; 16 : 12 And from thence to Philippi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days . 16 : 13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither . 16 : 14 And a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple ,	l
the doors were opened , and every one ' s bands were loosed . 16 : 27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled . 16 : 28 But Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , Do thyself no harm : for we are all here . 16 : 29 Then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Silas , 16 : 30 And brought them out , and said , Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? 16 : 31 And they said , Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ , and thou shalt be saved , and thy house . 16 : 32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house . 16 : 33 And he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all	l
: 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people . 17 : 14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still . 17 : 15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed . 17 : 16 Now while Paul	s
unto them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly . 18 : 27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace : 18 : 28 For he mightily convinced the Jews , and that publickly , shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ . 19 : 1 And it came to pass , that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul having passed through the upper	s
kingdom of God . 19 : 9 But when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus . 19 : 10 And this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks . 19 : 11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul : 19 : 12 So that from	s
and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews : 20 : 20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house , 20 : 21 Testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ . 20 : 22 And now , behold , I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there : 20 : 23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me . 20 : 24 But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God . 20 : 25 And now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching	l
the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more . 20 : 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men . 20 : 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God . 20 : 28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood . 20 : 29 For I	s
, he said unto the chief captain , May I speak unto thee ? Who said , Canst thou speak Greek ? 21 : 38 Art not thou that Egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ? 21 : 39 But Paul said , I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus , a city in Cilicia , a citizen of no mean city : and , I beseech thee , suffer me to speak unto the people . 21 : 40 And when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . And when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying , 22 : 1 Men , brethren , and fathers , hear ye my defence which I make now unto you . 22 : 2 ( And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith ,) 22 : 3 I am verily a man which	l
day . 24 : 22 And when Felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , When Lysias the chief captain shall come down , I will know the uttermost of your matter . 24 : 23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him . 24 : 24 And after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess	s
, he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ . 24 : 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come , Felix trembled , and answered , Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season , I will call for thee . 24 : 26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him . 24 : 27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix ' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound . 25 : 1 Now when Festus was come into the province , after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem . 25 : 2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul , and besought him , 25 : 3 And desired favour against him , that he would send for him to Jerusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him . 25 : 4 But Festus answered	l
, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea , and that he himself would depart shortly thither . 25 : 5 Let them therefore , said he , which among you are able , go down with me , and accuse this man , if there be any wickedness in him . 25 : 6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days , he went down unto Caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought . 25 : 7 And when he was come , the Jews which	s
multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer . 25 : 25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus , I have determined to send him . 25 : 26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord . Wherefore I have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , O king Agrippa , that , after examination had , I might have somewhat to write . 25 : 27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him . 26 : 1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Thou art permitted to speak for thyself . Then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself : 26 : 2 I think myself happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews : 26 : 3 Especially because I know	l
thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently . 26 : 4 My manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ; 26 : 5 Which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee . 26 : 6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God	s
a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me . 26 : 14 And when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks . 26 : 15 And I said , Who art thou , Lord ? And he said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest . 26 : 16 But rise	s
28 : 5 And he shook off the beast into the fire , and felt no harm . 28 : 6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen , or fallen down dead suddenly : but after they had looked a great while , and saw no harm come to him , they changed their minds , and said that he was a god . 28 : 7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was Publius ; who received us , and lodged us three days courteously . 28	s
2 : 3 And thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ? 2 : 4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ? 2 : 5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ; 2 : 6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds : 2 : 7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality , eternal life : 2 : 8 But unto them that are contentious , and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , indignation and wrath , 2 : 9 Tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that doeth evil , of the Jew first , and also of the Gentile ; 2 : 10 But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the Jew	l
? 2 : 22 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ? 2 : 23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou God ? 2 : 24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you , as it is written . 2 : 25 For circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .	s
man a liar ; as it is written , That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged . 3 : 5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( I speak as a man ) 3 : 6 God forbid : for then how shall God judge the world ? 3 : 7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory ; why yet am I also judged as a	s
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested , being witnessed by the law and the prophets ; 3 : 22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference : 3 : 23 For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God ; 3 : 24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus : 3 : 25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ; 3 : 26 To declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus . 3 : 27 Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what law ? of works ? Nay : but by the law of faith . 3 : 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the	l
: 22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness . 4 : 23 Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him ; 4 : 24 But for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ; 4 : 25 Who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification . 5 : 1 Therefore being justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ : 5 : 2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God . 5 : 3 And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ; 5 : 4 And patience , experience ; and experience , hope : 5 : 5 And hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us . 5 : 6 For when we were yet	l
to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life . 5 : 11 And not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement . 5 : 12 Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned : 5 : 13 ( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law . 5 : 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam ' s transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come . 5 : 15 But not as the offence , so also is the free gift . For if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded	l
1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit . 8 : 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death . 8 : 3 For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh : 8 : 4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit . 8 : 5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit . 8 : 6 For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace . 8 : 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can	l
us , who can be against us ? 8 : 32 He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ? 8 : 33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God ' s elect ? It is God that justifieth . 8 : 34 Who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us . 8 : 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ? 8 : 36 As it is written , For thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter . 8 : 37 Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us . 8 : 38 For I am persuaded , that neither death , nor life ,	l
, but also of the Gentiles ? 9 : 25 As he saith also in Osee , I will call them my people , which were not my people ; and her beloved , which was not beloved . 9 : 26 And it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God . 9 : 27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved : 9 : 28 For he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth . 9 : 29 And as Esaias said before , Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed , we had been as Sodoma , and been made like unto Gomorrha . 9 : 30 What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is	l
, the word of faith , which we preach ; 10 : 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved . 10 : 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation . 10 : 11 For the scripture saith , Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed . 10 : 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for	s
the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him . 10 : 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved . 10 : 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ? 10 : 15 And how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things ! 10 : 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Esaias saith , Lord , who hath believed our report ? 10 : 17 So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of God . 10 : 18 But I say , Have they not heard ? Yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world . 10 : 19 But I say , Did not Israel know ? First	l
God spared not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spare not thee . 11 : 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off . 11 : 23 And they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for God is able to graff them in again . 11 : 24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be graffed into their own olive tree ? 11 : 25 For I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in . 11 : 26 And so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written	l
, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob : 11 : 27 For this is my covenant unto them , when I shall take away their sins . 11 : 28 As concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the father ' s sakes . 11 : 29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance . 11 : 30 For as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained	s
renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God . 12 : 3 For I say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith . 12 : 4 For as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office : 12	s
with all men . 12 : 19 Dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord . 12 : 20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink : for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head . 12 : 21 Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good . 13 : 1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . For there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God . 13 : 2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation . 13 : 3 For rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same : 13 : 4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good	l
to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honour to whom honour . 13 : 8 Owe no man any thing , but to love one another : for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law . 13 : 9 For this , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness , Thou shalt not covet ; and if there be any other commandment , it is briefly comprehended in this saying , namely , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . 13 : 10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour : therefore love is the fulfilling of the law . 13 : 11 And that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleep : for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed . 13 : 12 The night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light . 13 : 13 Let us walk	l
8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers : 15 : 9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy ; as it is written , For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles , and sing unto thy name . 15 : 10 And again he saith , Rejoice , ye Gentiles , with his people . 15 : 11 And again , Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles ; and laud him ,	s
your prayers to God for me ; 15 : 31 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ; 15 : 32 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed . 15 : 33 Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen . 16 : 1 I commend unto you Phebe our sister , which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea : 16 : 2 That ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also . 16 : 3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus : 16 : 4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks : unto whom not only I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles . 16 : 5 Likewise greet the church that is in their	l
Tertius , who wrote this epistle , salute you in the Lord . 16 : 23 Gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you . Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and Quartus a brother . 16 : 24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen . 16 : 25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began , 16 : 26 But now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith : 16 : 27 To God only wise , be glory through Jesus Christ for ever . Amen . The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1 : 1 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and Sosthenes our brother , 1 : 2 Unto the church of God which is	l
are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God . 1 : 25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness of God is stronger than men . 1 : 26 For ye see your calling , brethren , how that not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called : 1 : 27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ; and God hath chosen the weak things	s
of the world to confound the things which are mighty ; 1 : 28 And base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are : 1 : 29 That no flesh should glory in his presence . 1 : 30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption : 1 : 31 That , according as it is written , He that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord . 2 : 1 And I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God . 2 : 2 For I determined not to know any thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified . 2 : 3 And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling . 2 : 4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of	l
man ' s wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power : 2 : 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God . 2 : 6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought : 2 : 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :	s
not speak unto you as unto spiritual , but as unto carnal , even as unto babes in Christ . 3 : 2 I have fed you with milk , and not with meat : for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able . 3 : 3 For ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not carnal , and walk as men ? 3 : 4 For while one saith , I am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not carnal ? 3 : 5 Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ? 3 : 6 I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase . 3 : 7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase . 3 : 8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive	l
his own reward according to his own labour . 3 : 9 For we are labourers together with God : ye are God ' s husbandry , ye are God ' s building . 3 : 10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon . 3 : 11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ . 3 : 12 Now	s
sakes ; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written , that no one of you be puffed up for one against another . 4 : 7 For who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ? 4 : 8 Now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and I would to God	s
I would not come to you . 4 : 19 But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are puffed up , but the power . 4 : 20 For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power . 4 : 21 What will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ? 5 : 1 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father ' s wife . 5 : 2 And ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you . 5 : 3 For I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed , 5 : 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ	l
but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God . 6 : 12 All things are lawful unto me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but I will not be brought under the power of any . 6 : 13 Meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but God shall destroy both it and them . Now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body . 6	s
of the Lord to be faithful . 7 : 26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be . 7 : 27 Art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife . 7 : 28 But and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh : but I spare you . 7 : 29 But this I say , brethren , the time is short : it remaineth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none ; 7 : 30 And they that weep , as though they wept not ; and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and they that buy , as though they possessed not ; 7 : 31 And they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away . 7 : 32 But I would	l
thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope . 9 : 11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ? 9 : 12 If others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? Nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ . 9 : 13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar ? 9 : 14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel . 9 : 15 But I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void . 9 : 16 For though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon	l
I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more . 9 : 20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ; 9 : 21 To them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ ,) that I might gain them that are without law . 9 : 22 To the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some . 9 : 23 And this I do for the gospel ' s sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you . 9 : 24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? So run , that ye may obtain . 9 : 25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in	l
' s wealth . 10 : 25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , that eat , asking no question for conscience sake : 10 : 26 For the earth is the Lord ' s , and the fulness thereof . 10 : 27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake . 10 : 28 But if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord ' s , and the fulness thereof : 10 : 29 Conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man ' s conscience ? 10 : 30 For if I by grace be a partaker , why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks ? 10 : 31 Whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all	l
teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ? 11 : 15 But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering . 11 : 16 But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God . 11 : 17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse . 11 : 18 For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it . 11 : 19 For there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you . 11 : 20 When ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord ' s supper . 11 : 21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper : and one is hungry , and	l
another is drunken . 11 : 22 What ? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ? What shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not . 11 : 23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you , That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread : 11 : 24 And when he had given thanks , he brake it	s
we all baptized into one body , whether we be Jews or Gentiles , whether we be bond or free ; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit . 12 : 14 For the body is not one member , but many . 12 : 15 If the foot shall say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ? 12 : 16 And if the ear shall say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ? 12 : 17 If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ? 12 : 18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him . 12 : 19 And if they were all one member , where were the body ? 12 : 20 But now are they many members , yet but one body . 12 : 21 And the eye cannot say unto	l
speaketh mysteries . 14 : 3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort . 14 : 4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church . 14 : 5 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying . 14 : 6 Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ? 14 : 7 And even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ? 14 : 8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ? 14 : 9 So likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to	l
be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air . 14 : 10 There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification . 14 : 11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me . 14 : 12 Even so ye , forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that	s
all authority and power . 15 : 25 For he must reign , till he hath put all enemies under his feet . 15 : 26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death . 15 : 27 For he hath put all things under his feet . But when he saith all things are put under him , it is manifest that he is excepted , which did put all things under him . 15 : 28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him , then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that	s
for him with the brethren . 16 : 12 As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time . 16 : 13 Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong . 16 : 14 Let all your things be done with charity . 16 : 15 I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas ,	s
. The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1 : 1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia : 1 : 2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ . 1 : 3 Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort	s
; 1 : 4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God . 1 : 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ . 1 : 6 And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation . 1 : 7 And our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation . 1 : 8 For we would not , brethren , have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life : 1 : 9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in	l
nay . 1 : 19 For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus , was not yea and nay , but in him was yea . 1 : 20 For all the promises of God in him are yea , and in him Amen , unto the glory of God by us . 1 : 21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ; 1 : 22 Who hath also sealed us , and	s
did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things . 2 : 10 To whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ; 2 : 11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us : for we are not ignorant of his devices . 2 : 12 Furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ ' s gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord , 2 : 13 I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother : but taking my leave of them , I went from thence into Macedonia . 2 : 14 Now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place . 2 : 15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ , in them that are saved , and in them that perish :	l
as Moses , which put a vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished : 3 : 14 But their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which vail is done away in Christ . 3 : 15 But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the vail is upon their heart . 3 : 16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord , the vail shall be taken away . 3 : 17 Now the Lord is that Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty . 3 : 18 But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the LORD . 4 : 1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we faint not ; 4 : 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty ,	l
in you . 4 : 13 We having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ; 4 : 14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you . 4 : 15 For all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God . 4 : 16 For which cause we faint	s
. 5 : 5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God , who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit . 5 : 6 Therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord : 5 : 7 ( For we walk by faith , not by sight :) 5 : 8 We are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord . 5	s
he was comforted in you , when he told us your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me ; so that I rejoiced the more . 7 : 8 For though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season . 7 : 9 Now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after	s
of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have . 8 : 12 For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not . 8 : 13 For I mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened : 8 : 14 But by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality : 8 : 15 As it is written , He that had gathered much had nothing over ; and he that had gathered little had no lack . 8 : 16 But thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you . 8 : 17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation ; but being more forward , of his own accord he went unto you . 8 : 18 And we have sent with him the brother	l
, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ; 8 : 19 And not that only , but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace , which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord , and declaration of your ready mind : 8 : 20 Avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us : 8 : 21 Providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of	s
be ready : 9 : 4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting . 9 : 5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren , that they would go before unto you , and make up beforehand your bounty , whereof ye had notice before , that the same might be ready , as a matter of bounty , and not as of covetousness . 9 : 6 But this I say ,	s
glory in the Lord . 10 : 18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved , but whom the Lord commendeth . 11 : 1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly : and indeed bear with me . 11 : 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ . 11 : 3 But I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty	s
deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ . 11 : 14 And no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light . 11 : 15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works . 11 : 16 I say again , Let no man think me a fool ; if otherwise , yet as a fool receive me , that I may boast myself a little . 11 : 17 That which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting . 11 : 18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also . 11 : 19 For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise . 11 : 20 For ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face . 11 : 21 I speak as	l
concerning reproach , as though we had been weak . Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold , ( I speak foolishly ,) I am bold also . 11 : 22 Are they Hebrews ? so am I . Are they Israelites ? so am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I . 11 : 23 Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as a fool ) I am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft . 11 : 24 Of the	s
Jews five times received I forty stripes save one . 11 : 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ; 11 : 26 In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ; 11 : 27 In weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness . 11 : 28 Beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches . 11 : 29 Who is weak , and I am not weak ? who is offended , and I burn not ? 11 : 30 If I must needs glory , I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities . 11 : 31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ	l
( whether in the body , I cannot tell ; or whether out of the body , I cannot tell : God knoweth ;) such an one caught up to the third heaven . 12 : 3 And I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I cannot tell : God knoweth ;) 12 : 4 How that he was caught up into paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter . 12 : 5 Of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities . 12 : 6 For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me . 12 : 7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of	l
before God in Christ : but we do all things , dearly beloved , for your edifying . 12 : 20 For I fear , lest , when I come , I shall not find you such as I would , and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not : lest there be debates , envyings , wraths , strifes , backbitings , whisperings , swellings , tumults : 12 : 21 And lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed . 13 : 1 This is the third time I am coming to you . In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . 13 : 2 I told you before , and foretell you , as if I were present , the second time ; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned , and to all other , that , if I come again , I will not spare :	l
is in you , except ye be reprobates ? 13 : 6 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates . 13 : 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates . 13 : 8 For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth . 13 : 9 For we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perfection . 13 : 10 Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should use sharpness , according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification , and not to destruction . 13 : 11 Finally , brethren , farewell . Be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you . 13 : 12 Greet one another with an holy kiss . 13 : 13 All the saints salute	l
to you and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ , 1 : 4 Who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of God and our Father : 1 : 5 To whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen . 1 : 6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel : 1 : 7 Which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ . 1 : 8 But though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed . 1 : 9 As we said before , so say I now again , if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accursed . 1 : 10 For do I now persuade men , or God ? or do I seek to please men ? for if	l
which were in Christ : 1 : 23 But they had heard only , That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed . 1 : 24 And they glorified God in me . 2 : 1 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took Titus with me also . 2 : 2 And I went up by revelation , and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but privately to them which were of reputation , lest by any means	s
I should run , or had run , in vain . 2 : 3 But neither Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised : 2 : 4 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in , who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage : 2 : 5 To whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you . 2 : 6 But of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : God accepteth no man ' s person :) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me : 2 : 7 But contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter ; 2 : 8 ( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward	l
promise : but God gave it to Abraham by promise . 3 : 19 Wherefore then serveth the law ? It was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator . 3 : 20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one . 3 : 21 Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law . 3 : 22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe . 3 : 23 But before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed . 3 : 24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith . 3 : 25 But after that faith is come , we are no longer	l
the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is Agar . 4 : 25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and answereth to Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children . 4 : 26 But Jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all . 4 : 27 For it is written , Rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband . 4 : 28 Now we , brethren , as Isaac was , are the children of promise . 4 : 29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit , even so it is now . 4 : 30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture ? Cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman . 4 : 31 So then , brethren , we are not children of	l
by the law ; ye are fallen from grace . 5 : 5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith . 5 : 6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love . 5 : 7 Ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ? 5 : 8 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you . 5 : 9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump . 5 : 10 I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be . 5 : 11 And I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased . 5 : 12 I would they were even cut off which trouble you . 5 : 13 For , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love	l
to the other : so that ye cannot do the things that ye would . 5 : 18 But if ye be led of the Spirit , ye are not under the law . 5 : 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these ; Adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness , 5 : 20 Idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , 5 : 21 Envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God . 5 : 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith , 5 : 23 Meekness , temperance : against such there is no law . 5 : 24 And they that are Christ ' s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts . 5 : 25 If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the	l
. 6 : 4 But let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another . 6 : 5 For every man shall bear his own burden . 6 : 6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things . 6 : 7 Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . 6 : 8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting . 6 : 9 And let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not . 6 : 10 As we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith . 6 : 11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand . 6 : 12 As many as desire to make a	l
exceeding greatness of his power to us - ward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power , 1 : 20 Which he wrought in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places , 1 : 21 Far above all principality , and power , and might , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come : 1 : 22 And hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church , 1 : 23 Which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all . 2 : 1 And you hath he quickened , who were dead in trespasses and sins ; 2 : 2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience : 2 : 3 Among whom also we all had our	l
nigh . 2 : 18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father . 2 : 19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellowcitizens with the saints , and of the household of God ; 2 : 20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ; 2 : 21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord : 2 : 22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit . 3 : 1 For this cause I Paul , the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles , 3 : 2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you - ward : 3 : 3 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery ; ( as I wrote afore in few words , 3 : 4 Whereby , when ye read , ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ ) 3 : 5 Which in other	l
ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ; 3 : 6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs , and of the same body , and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel : 3 : 7 Whereof I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power . 3 : 8 Unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , is	s
from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart : 4 : 19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness . 4 : 20 But ye have not so learned Christ ; 4 : 21 If so be that ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , as the truth is in Jesus : 4 : 22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man , which is corrupt according to the	s
all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as becometh saints ; 5 : 4 Neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks . 5 : 5 For this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God . 5 : 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience . 5 : 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them . 5 : 8 For ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light : 5 : 9 ( For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ;) 5 : 10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord . 5 : 11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them . 5 : 12 For it is a shame	l
even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret . 5 : 13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light . 5 : 14 Wherefore he saith , Awake thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall give thee light . 5 : 15 See then that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as wise , 5 : 16 Redeeming the time , because the days are evil . 5 : 17 Wherefore be ye	s
in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ; 6 : 6 Not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but as the servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ; 6 : 7 With good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men : 6 : 8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free . 6 : 9 And , ye masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatening	s
6 : 17 And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God : 6 : 18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ; 6 : 19 And for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel , 6 : 20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds : that therein I may speak boldly	s
: 23 Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me . 2 : 24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly . 2 : 25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants . 2 : 26 For he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick . 2 : 27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow . 2 : 28 I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful . 2 : 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation : 2 : 30 Because for the work	l
10 That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ; 3 : 11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead . 3 : 12 Not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus . 3 : 13 Brethren , I count not myself to have apprehended : but this one thing I	s
do , forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before , 3 : 14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus . 3 : 15 Let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you . 3 : 16 Nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing . 3 : 17 Brethren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample . 3 : 18 ( For many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ : 3 : 19 Whose end is destruction , whose God is their belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things .) 3 : 20 For our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also	l
meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light : 1 : 13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son : 1 : 14 In whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins : 1 : 15 Who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature : 1 : 16 For by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him : 1 : 17 And he is before all things , and by him all things consist . 1 : 18 And he is the head of the body , the church : who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence . 1 : 19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell ; 1 : 20 And , having	l
made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven . 1 : 21 And you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled 1 : 22 In the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight : 1 : 23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not	s
handle not ; 2 : 22 Which all are to perish with the using ;) after the commandments and doctrines of men ? 2 : 23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship , and humility , and neglecting of the body : not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh . 3 : 1 If ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God . 3 : 2 Set your affection on things above , not on things on	s
singleness of heart , fearing God ; 3 : 23 And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men ; 3 : 24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance : for ye serve the Lord Christ . 3 : 25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons . 4 : 1 Masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have	s
: 10 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you , and Marcus , sister ' s son to Barnabas , ( touching whom ye received commandments : if he come unto you , receive him ;) 4 : 11 And Jesus , which is called Justus , who are of the circumcision . These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God , which have been a comfort unto me . 4 : 12 Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , saluteth you , always labouring fervently for you in prayers , that ye may	s
stand perfect and complete in all the will of God . 4 : 13 For I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis . 4 : 14 Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas , greet you . 4 : 15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the church which is in his house . 4 : 16 And when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea . 4 : 17 And say to Archippus , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfil it . 4 : 18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul . Remember my bonds . Grace be with you . Amen . The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1 : 1 Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord	l
I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another . 4 : 10 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ; 4 : 11 And that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ; 4 : 12 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without , and that ye may have lack	s
of nothing . 4 : 13 But I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope . 4 : 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him . 4 : 15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord , that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep . 4 : 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first : 4 : 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord . 4 : 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words . 5 : 1 But of the times and the seasons	l
the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer : 1 : 6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you ; 1 : 7 And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels , 1 : 8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ : 1 : 9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ; 1 : 10 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day . 1 : 11 Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power : 1	l
that thou by them mightest war a good warfare ; 1 : 19 Holding faith , and a good conscience ; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck : 1 : 20 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme . 2 : 1 I exhort therefore , that , first of all , supplications , prayers , intercessions , and giving of thanks , be made for all men ; 2 : 2 For kings , and for all that are in authority	s
with good works . 2 : 11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection . 2 : 12 But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence . 2 : 13 For Adam was first formed , then Eve . 2 : 14 And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression . 2 : 15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety . 3 : 1	s
know the truth . 4 : 4 For every creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving : 4 : 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer . 4 : 6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained . 4 : 7 But refuse profane and old wives ' fables , and exercise thyself rather	s
to shew piety at home , and to requite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before God . 5 : 5 Now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day . 5 : 6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth . 5 : 7 And these things give in charge , that they may be blameless . 5 : 8 But if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel . 5 : 9 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man . 5 : 10 Well reported of for good works ; if she have brought up children , if she have lodged strangers , if she have washed the saints ' feet , if she have relieved the afflicted , if she have diligently followed every good work . 5 : 11 But the younger widows refuse : for when they have	l
little wine for thy stomach ' s sake and thine often infirmities . 5 : 24 Some men ' s sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after . 5 : 25 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand ; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid . 6 : 1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed . 6 : 2 And they that have	s
if we deny him , he also will deny us : 2 : 13 If we believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he cannot deny himself . 2 : 14 Of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers . 2 : 15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth . 2 : 16 But shun profane and vain babblings :	s
crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing . 4 : 9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me : 4 : 10 For Demas hath forsaken me , having loved this present world , and is departed unto Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , Titus unto Dalmatia . 4 : 11 Only Luke is with me . Take Mark , and bring him with thee : for he is profitable to me for the ministry . 4 : 12 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus . 4 : 13 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments . 4 : 14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the Lord reward him according to his works : 4 : 15 Of whom be thou ware also ; for he hath greatly withstood our words . 4 : 16 At my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook	l
Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers , to obey magistrates , to be ready to every good work , 3 : 2 To speak evil of no man , to be no brawlers , but gentle , shewing all meekness unto all men . 3 : 3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving divers lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another . 3 : 4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared , 3 : 5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the Holy Ghost ; 3 : 6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour ; 3 : 7 That being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life . 3 : 8 This is a faithful saying , and these things I will that thou affirm constantly , that they which have believed in God	l
say . 1 : 22 But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you . 1 : 23 There salute thee Epaphras , my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus ; 1 : 24 Marcus , Aristarchus , Demas , Lucas , my fellowlabourers . 1 : 25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen . The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1 : 1 God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets , 1 : 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ; 1 : 3 Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high : 1 : 4 Being made so much better than the angels ,	l
as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they . 1 : 5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ? And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ? 1 : 6 And again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him . 1 : 7 And of the angels he saith , Who	s
and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man . 2 : 10 For it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings . 2 : 11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren , 2 : 12 Saying , I will declare thy name unto my brethren ,	s
this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works . 4 : 5 And in this place again , If they shall enter into my rest . 4 : 6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief : 4 : 7 Again , he limiteth a certain day , saying in David , To day , after so long a time ; as it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not	s
the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . 7 : 1 For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ; 7 : 2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ; 7 : 3 Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually . 7 : 4 Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils . 7 : 5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out	l
Lord . And again , The Lord shall judge his people . 10 : 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God . 10 : 32 But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ; 10 : 33 Partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used . 10 : 34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds	s
11 : 22 By faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones . 11 : 23 By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king ' s commandment . 11 : 24 By faith Moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ' s daughter ; 11 : 25 Choosing	s
rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ; 11 : 26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward . 11 : 27 By faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible . 11 : 28 Through faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them . 11 : 29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned . 11 : 30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days . 11 : 31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace . 11 : 32 And what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson	l
a better resurrection : 11 : 36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment : 11 : 37 They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ; 11 : 38 ( Of whom the world was not worthy :) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth . 11 : 39 And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise : 11 : 40 God having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect . 12 : 1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses , let us lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so easily beset us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us , 12 : 2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy	l
art rebuked of him : 12 : 6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth . 12 : 7 If ye endure chastening , God dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not ? 12 : 8 But if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons . 12 : 9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits , and live ? 12 : 10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness . 12 : 11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby . 12 : 12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ; 12 : 13 And make	l
his birthright . 12 : 17 For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears . 12 : 18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest , 12 : 19 And the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more : 12 : 20 ( For they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart : 12 : 21 And so terrible was the sight , that Moses said , I exceedingly fear and quake :) 12 : 22 But ye are come unto mount Sion , and unto the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels , 12 : 23 To	l
faith , nothing wavering . For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed . 1 : 7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord . 1 : 8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways . 1 : 9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted : 1 : 10 But the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away . 1 : 11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat , but it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways . 1 : 12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him . 1 : 13 Let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God	l
transgressor of the law . 2 : 12 So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty . 2 : 13 For he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment . 2 : 14 What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ? can faith save him ? 2 : 15 If a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of daily food , 2 : 16 And one of you say unto them , Depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ? 2 : 17 Even so faith , if it hath not works , is dead , being alone . 2 : 18 Yea , a man may say , Thou hast faith , and I have works : shew me thy faith without thy works , and I will shew thee my faith by my works . 2 : 19 Thou believest that	l
for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God . 2 : 24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only . 2 : 25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ? 2 : 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also . 3 : 1 My brethren , be not many masters , knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation . 3 : 2 For in many things we offend all . If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body . 3 : 3 Behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body . 3 : 4 Behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever	l
of sabaoth . 5 : 5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter . 5 : 6 Ye have condemned and killed the just ; and he doth not resist you . 5 : 7 Be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain . 5 : 8 Be ye also patient ; stablish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh . 5 : 9 Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : behold , the judge standeth before the door . 5 : 10 Take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience . 5 : 11 Behold , we count them happy which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of	l
the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy . 5 : 12 But above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath : but let your yea be yea ; and your nay , nay ; lest ye fall into condemnation . 5 : 13 Is any among you afflicted ? let him pray . Is any merry ? let him sing psalms . 5 : 14 Is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders	s
of that which is good ? 3 : 14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ; 3 : 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear : 3 : 16 Having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ . 3 : 17 For it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing . 3 : 18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit : 3 : 19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ; 3 : 20 Which sometime were disobedient	l
, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water . 3 : 21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us ( not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God ,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ : 3 : 22 Who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers	s
: 7 But the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore sober , and watch unto prayer . 4 : 8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins . 4 : 9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging . 4 : 10 As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God . 4 : 11 If any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of	s
settle you . 5 : 11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen . 5 : 12 By Silvanus , a faithful brother unto you , as I suppose , I have written briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand . 5 : 13 The church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son . 5 : 14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus . Amen . The Second General Epistle of Peter 1 : 1 Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ : 1 : 2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord , 1 : 3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called	l
: 8 For if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ . 1 : 9 But he that lacketh these things is blind , and cannot see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins . 1 : 10 Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall : 1 : 11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . 1 : 12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth . 1 : 13 Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ; 1 : 14 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ	l
wages of unrighteousness ; 2 : 16 But was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumb ass speaking with man ' s voice forbad the madness of the prophet . 2 : 17 These are wells without water , clouds that are carried with a tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever . 2 : 18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error . 2 : 19 While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage . 2 : 20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning . 2 : 21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known	l
seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness . 3 : 18 But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and for ever . Amen . The First Epistle General of John 1 : 1 That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled	s
In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother . 3 : 11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another . 3 : 12 Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother ' s righteous . 3 : 13 Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you . 3 : 14 We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death . 3 : 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him . 3 : 16 Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren . 3 : 17 But whoso	l
is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error . 4 : 7 Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God . 4 : 8 He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love . 4 : 9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him . 4 : 10 Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins . 4 : 11 Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another . 4 : 12 No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us . 4 : 13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us ,	l
the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous . 5 : 4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith . 5 : 5 Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ? 5 : 6 This is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the	s
5 : 16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death . There is a sin unto death : I do not say that he shall pray for it . 5 : 17 All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death . 5 : 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not . 5 : 19 And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness . 5 : 20 And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life . 5 : 21 Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen . The Second Epistle General of John 1 :	l
the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true . 1 : 13 I had many things to write , but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee : 1 : 14 But I trust I shall shortly see thee , and we shall speak face to face . Peace be to thee . Our friends salute thee . Greet the friends by name . The General Epistle of Jude 1 : 1 Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called : 1 : 2 Mercy unto you , and peace , and love , be multiplied . 1 : 3 Beloved , when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints . 1 : 4 For there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old	l
are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him . 1 : 16 These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men ' s persons in admiration because of advantage . 1 : 17 But , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ; 1 : 18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts . 1 : 19 These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit . 1 : 20 But ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost , 1 : 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life . 1 : 22 And of some have compassion , making a difference : 1 : 23 And others save with fear , pulling	l
which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John : 1 : 2 Who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw . 1 : 3 Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand . 1 : 4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ; 1 : 5 And from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth . Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood , 1 : 6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory	l
place , except thou repent . 2 : 6 But this thou hast , that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes , which I also hate . 2 : 7 He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God . 2 : 8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ; 2 : 9 I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan . 2 : 10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a	l
crown of life . 2 : 11 He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death . 2 : 12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write ; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges ; 2 : 13 I know thy works , and where thou dwellest , even where Satan ' s seat is : and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in	s
strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God . 3 : 3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee . 3 : 4 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy . 3 : 5 He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels . 3 : 6 He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches . 3 : 7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the	l
midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth . 5 : 7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne . 5 : 8 And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the	s
fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ; 8 : 9 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed . 8 : 10 And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ; 8 : 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter . 8 : 12 And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise . 8 : 13 And I beheld , and heard	l
as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit . 9 : 3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power . 9 : 4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads . 9 : 5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man . 9 : 6 And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them . 9 : 7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold	l
And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon . 9 : 12 One woe is past ; and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter . 9 : 13 And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God , 9 : 14 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates . 9 : 15 And the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men . 9 : 16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them . 9 : 17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth	l
, and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone . 9 : 18 By these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths . 9 : 19 For their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt . 9	s
: 20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk : 9 : 21 Neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts . 10 : 1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire : 10 : 2 And he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth , 10 : 3 And cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roareth : and when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices . 10 : 4 And when the seven thunders had	l
: 11 And he said unto me , Thou must prophesy again before many peoples , and nations , and tongues , and kings . 11 : 1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod : and the angel stood , saying , Rise , and measure the temple of God , and the altar , and them that worship therein . 11 : 2 But the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread	s
under foot forty and two months . 11 : 3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth . 11 : 4 These are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth . 11 : 5 And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed . 11 : 6 These have power to shut heaven , that it rain not in the days of their prophecy : and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will . 11 : 7 And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them . 11 : 8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is	l
them which destroy the earth . 11 : 19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail . 12 : 1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars : 12 : 2 And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered . 12 : 3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads . 12 : 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born . 12 : 5 And she brought forth a man child ,	l
7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations . 13 : 8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world . 13 : 9 If any man have an ear , let him hear . 13 : 10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . Here is the patience and the faith of the saints . 13 : 11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and he spake as a dragon . 13 : 12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed . 13 : 13 And he doeth great wonders , so that he	l

These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth . These were redeemed from among men , being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb	s

smiles on the night . Farewell , green fields and happy grove , Where flocks have ta ' en delight . Where lambs have nibbled , silent move The feet of angels bright ; Unseen they pour blessing , And joy without ceasing , On each bud and blossom , And each sleeping bosom . They look in every thoughtless nest Where birds are covered warm ; They visit caves of every beast , To keep them all from harm : If they see any weeping That should have been sleeping , They pour sleep on their head , And sit down by their bed . When wolves and tigers howl for prey , They pitying stand and weep ; Seeking to drive their thirst away , And keep them from the sheep . But , if they rush dreadful , The angels , most heedful , Receive each mild spirit , New worlds to inherit . And there the lion ' s ruddy eyes Shall flow with tears of gold : And pitying the tender cries , And walking round the fold : Saying : " Wrath by His meekness , And , by His health , sickness ,	l
Are driven away From our immortal day . " And now beside thee , bleating lamb , I can lie down and sleep , Or think on Him who bore thy name , Graze after thee , and weep . For , washed in life ' s river , My bright mane for ever Shall shine like the gold , As I guard o ' er the fold ." SPRING Sound the flute ! Now it ' s mute !

NURSE ' S SONG When the voices of children are heard on the green , And laughing is heard on the hill , My heart is at rest within my breast , And everything else is still . " Then come home , my children , the sun is gone down , And the dews of night arise ; Come , come , leave off play , and let us away , Till the morning appears in the skies ." " No , no , let us play , for it is yet day , And we cannot go to sleep ; Besides , in the sky the little birds fly , And the	l
, O Earth , return ! Arise from out the dewy grass ! Night is worn , And the morn Rises from the slumbrous mass . " Turn away no more ; Why wilt thou turn away ? The starry floor , The watery shore , Are given thee till the break of day ." EARTH ' S ANSWER Earth raised up her head From the darkness dread and drear , Her light fled , Stony , dread , And her locks covered with grey despair . " Prisoned on watery shore , Starry jealousy does keep my den Cold	s
, naked , piping loud , Like a fiend hid in a cloud . Struggling in my father ' s hands , Striving against my swaddling - bands , Bound and weary , I thought best To sulk upon my mother ' s breast . A POISON TREE I was angry with my friend : I told my wrath , my wrath did end . I was angry with my foe : I told it not , my wrath did grow . And I watered it in fears Night and morning with my tears , And I sunned it with	s

From house to house he goes , A messenger small and slight , And whether it rains or snows , He sleeps outside in the night . ( The path .) THE LITTLE YELLOW TULIP Once there was a little yellow Tulip , and she lived down in a little dark house under the ground . One day she was sitting there , all by herself , and it was very still . Suddenly , she heard a little _tap , tap , tap_ , at the door . " Who is that ?" she said . " It ' s the Rain , and I want to come in ," said a soft , sad , little voice . " No , you can ' t come in ," the little Tulip said . By and by she heard another little _tap , tap , tap_ on the window - pane . " Who is there ?" she said . The same soft little voice answered , " It	l
, " Men of earth , I will help you , come what may !" The thought made her suddenly marvellously big and strong and powerful . Never had she dreamed that she could be so big . Like a mighty angel of blessing she stood above the earth , and lifted her head and spread her wings far over the fields and woods . She was so great , so majestic , that men and animals were awe - struck at the sight ; the trees and the grasses bowed before her ; yet all the earth - creatures	s
When it was time for the Gingerbread Boy to be done she opened the oven door and pulled out the pan . Out jumped the little Gingerbread Boy on to the floor , and away he ran , out of the door and down the street ! The little old woman and the little old man ran after him as fast as they could , but he just laughed , and shouted ,-- " Run ! run ! as fast as you can ! " You can ' t catch me , I ' m the Gingerbread Man !" And they couldn ' t catch him . The little Gingerbread Boy ran on and on , until he came to a cow , by the roadside . " Stop , little Gingerbread Boy ," said the cow ; " I want to eat you ." The little Gingerbread Boy laughed and said ,-- " I have run away from a little old woman , " And a little old man , " And I can run away from you , I can !" And , as the cow chased him , he looked over his shoulder and cried ,-- "	l
as he ran he chuckled ,-- " I have run away from a little old woman , " A little old man , " A cow , " A horse , " A barn full of threshers , " A field full of mowers , " And I can run away from you , I can ! " Run ! run ! as fast as you can ! " You can ' t catch me , I ' m the Gingerbread Man !" " Why ," said the fox , " I would not catch you if I could .	s
I would not think of disturbing you ." Just then , the little Gingerbread Boy came to a river . He could not swim across , and he wanted to keep running away from the cow and the horse and the people . " Jump on my tail , and I will take you across ," said the fox . So the little Gingerbread Boy jumped on the fox ' s tail , and the fox began to swim the river . When he was a little way from the bank he turned his head , and said , " You are too heavy on my tail , little Gingerbread Boy , I fear I shall let you get wet ; jump on my back ." The little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his back . A little farther out , the fox said , " I am afraid the water will cover you , there ; jump on my shoulder ." The little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his shoulder . In the middle of the stream the fox said , " Oh , dear ! little Gingerbread Boy , my shoulder is sinking ; jump on my nose , and	l
. " The minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard , and you ' re dead ." The little Country Mouse looked at the trap , and he looked at the cheese , and he looked at the little City Mouse . " If you ' ll excuse me ," he said , " I think I will go home . I ' d rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort , than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese ,-- and be frightened	s
" Yes ," at once . " Then ," said the Rabbit , " I will tie this end of my long rope to you , and I will run away and tie the other end round my cow , and when I am ready I will beat my big drum . When you hear that , pull very , very hard , for the cow is stuck very deep in the mud ." " Huh !" grunted the Whale , " I ' ll pull her out , if she is stuck to the horns ." Little Brother Rabbit tied the rope - end to the Whale , and ran off , lippety , lippety , till he came to the place where the Elephant was . " Oh , please , mighty and kindly Elephant ," he said , making a very low bow , " will you do me a favour ?" " What is it ?" asked the Elephant . " My cow is stuck in the mud , about a quarter of a mile from here ," said little Brother Rabbit , " and I cannot pull her out . Of course you could .	l
pulled his best . At the jerk , up came the Whale out of the water . " Who is pulling me ?" spouted the Whale . " Who is pulling me ?" trumpeted the Elephant . And then each saw the rope in the other ' s hold . " I ' ll teach you to play cow !" roared the Elephant . " I ' ll show you how to fool me !" fumed the Whale . And they began to pull again . But this time the rope broke , the Whale turned a somersault , and the Elephant fell over backward . At that , they were both so ashamed that neither would speak to the other . So that broke up the bargain between them . And little Brother Rabbit sat in the bushes and laughed , and laughed , and laughed . THE LITTLE HALF - CHICK There was once upon a time a Spanish Hen , who hatched out some nice little chickens . She was much pleased with their looks as they came from the shell . One , two , three , came out plump and fluffy ; but when the	l

" I cannot be bothered with you ; I am off to Madrid , to see the King !" And he went laughing off , hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick . When he had hoppity - kicked a good way , and was near Madrid , he came to a clump of bushes , where the Wind was caught fast . The Wind was whimpering , and begging to be set free . " Little Half - Chick ," said the Wind , " you are just in time to help me ; if you will brush aside these twigs and leaves , I can get my breath ; help me , quickly !" " Ho ! the idea !" said the little Half - Chick " I have no time to bother with you . I am going to Madrid , to see the King ." And he went off , hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , leaving the Wind to	l
" Dear me ," she said , " this chicken is no good ; it is burned to a cinder ." And she picked the little Half - Chick up by one leg and threw him out of the window . In the air he was caught by a breeze and taken up higher than the trees . Round and round he was twirled till he was so dizzy he thought he must perish . " Don ' t blow me so , Wind ," he cried , " let me down !" " Little Half - Chick , little	s
forward to look into his dear round face . He was not asleep , but was watching very earnestly a blackberry - bush , that waved its one tall , dark - red spray in the wind outside the fence . " What are you thinking about , my darling ?" she said , smoothing his soft , honey - coloured hair . " The blackberry - bush , mamma ; what does it say ? It keeps nodding , nodding to me behind the fence ; what does it say , mamma ?" " It says ," she answered	s
summer wind ; and every day they watch me grow more beautiful , till at last I shake out blossoms , fair and fragrant . "' A few days more , and I drop the white petals down among the grass , and , lo ! there are the green tiny berries ! Carefully I hold them up to the sun ; carefully I gather the dew in the summer nights ; slowly they ripen ; they grow larger and redder and darker , and at last they are black , shining , delicious . I hold them as high	s
Of yellow tide - foam ; Some in the reeds Of the black mountain - lake , With frogs for their watch - dogs , All night awake . High on the hilltop The old King sits ; He is now so old and gray , He ' s nigh lost his wits . With a bridge of white mist Columbkill he crosses , On his stately journeys From Slieveleague to Rosses ; Or going up with music On cold starry nights , To sup with the Queen Of the gay Northern Lights . They stole little Bridget For seven years long ; When she came down again Her friends were all gone . They took her lightly back , Between the night and morrow ; They thought that she was fast asleep , But she was dead with sorrow . They have kept her ever since Deep within the lake , On a bed of flag - leaves , Watching till she wake . By the craggy hillside , Through the mosses bare , They have planted thorn - trees , For pleasure here and there . Is any man so daring As dig them up in spite ,	l
He shall find their sharpest thorns In his bed at night . Up the airy mountain , Down the rushy glen , We daren ' t go a - hunting For fear of little men . Wee folk , good folk , Trooping all together ; Green jacket , red cap , And white owl ' s feather ! THE ADVENTURES OF THE LITTLE FIELD MOUSE Once upon a time , there was a little brown Field Mouse ; and one day he was out in the fields to see what he could find . He was running along in	s
little red jacket , and odd little red shoes with points at the toes . " You are my prisoner ," he said to the Field Mouse . " What for ?" said the Field Mouse . " Because you tried to steal my acorn ," said the little Red Man . " It is my acorn ," said the Field Mouse ; " I found it ." " No , it isn ' t ," said the little Red Man , " I have it ; you will never see it again ." The little Field Mouse looked all about the room as fast as he could , but he could not see any acorn . Then he thought he would go back up the tiny stairs to his own home . But the little door was locked , and the little Red Man had the key . And he said to the poor mouse ,-- " You shall be my servant ; you shall make my bed and sweep my room and cook my broth ." So the little brown Mouse was the little Red Man ' s servant , and every day he made the little Red	l
noticing ,-- he was in such a hurry . The little Field Mouse knew that his chance had come to run away home . But he didn ' t want to go without the pretty , shiny acorn . Where it was he didn ' t know , so he looked everywhere . He opened every little drawer and looked in , but it wasn ' t in any of the drawers ; he peeped on every shelf , but it wasn ' t on a shelf ; he hunted in every closet , but it wasn ' t in there . Finally , he climbed up on a chair and opened a wee , wee door in the chimney - piece ,-- and there it was ! He took it quickly in his forepaws , and then he took it in his mouth , and then he ran away . He pushed open the little door ; he climbed up , up , up the little stairs ; he came out through the hole under the root ; he ran and ran through the fields ; and at last he came to his own house . When he was	l
And when she wasn ' t wearing it she kept it in the shiny acorn box . And the little Red Man never knew what had become of it , because he didn ' t know where the little Field Mouse lived . ANOTHER LITTLE RED HEN Once upon a time there was a little Red Hen , who lived on a farm all by herself . An old Fox , crafty and sly , had a den in the rocks , on a hill near her house . Many and many a night this old Fox used to lie awake and think to himself how good that little Red Hen would taste if he could once get her in his big kettle and boil her for dinner . But he couldn ' t catch the little Red Hen , because she was too wise for him . Every time she went out to market she locked the door of the house behind her , and as soon as she came in again she locked the door behind her and put the key in her apron pocket , where she kept her scissors and some sugar candy . At last	l
think She lept right out -- she did , An ' thin picked up a great big shtone , An ' popped it in instid . An ' thin she rins off home , Her outside door she locks ; Thinks she , " You see you don ' t have me , You crafty , shly ould Fox ." An ' Fox he tugged away Wid the great big hivy shtone , Thimpin ' his shoulders very bad As he wint in alone . An ' whin he came in sight O ' his great din o ' rocks	s
to carry to his Mammy ; a brown , fresh , crusty loaf of bread . So Epaminondas tied a string around the end of the loaf and took hold of the end of the string and came along home , like this . ( Imitate dragging something along the ground .) When he got home his Mammy looked at the thing on the end of the string , and she said ,-- " My laws a - massy ! Epaminondas , what you got on the end of that string ?" " Bread , Mammy ," said Epaminondas ; " Auntie gave it to me ." " Bread !!!" said his Mammy . " O Epaminondas , Epaminondas , you ain ' t got the sense you was born with ; you never did have the sense you was born with ; you never will have the sense you was born with ! Now I ain ' t gwine tell you any more ways to bring truck home . And don ' t you go see your Auntie , neither . I ' ll go see her my own self . But I ' ll just tell you one	l
thing , Epaminondas ! You see these here six mince pies I done make ? You see how I done set ' em on the doorstep to cool ? Well , now , you hear me , Epaminondas , _you be careful how you step on those pies_ !" " Yes , Mammy ," said Epaminondas . Then Epaminondas ' Mammy put on her bonnet and her shawl and took a basket in her hand and went away to see Auntie . The six mince pies sat cooling in a row on the doorstep . And then ,-- and then	s
,-- Epaminondas _was_ careful how he stepped on those pies ! He stepped ( imitate )-- right -- in -- the -- middle -- of -- every -- one . * * * * * And , do you know , children , nobody knows what happened next ! The person who told me the story didn ' t know ; nobody knows . But you can guess . THE BOY WHO CRIED " WOLF !" There was once a shepherd - boy who kept his flock at a little distance from the village . Once he thought he would play a trick on the villagers and have some fun at their expense . So he ran toward the village crying out , with all his might ,-- " Wolf ! Wolf ! Come and help ! The wolves are at my lambs !" The kind villagers left their work and ran to the field to help him . But when they got there the boy laughed at them for their pains ; there was no wolf there . Still another day the boy tried the same trick , and the villagers came running to help and got laughed at	l
river . Then , one day he got a feeling inside him that nothing but crabs could satisfy : he felt that he must have at least one crab . Very cautiously , he went down to the river and looked all around . He saw no sign of the old Alligator . Still , he did not mean to take any chances . So he stood quite still and began to talk to himself ,-- it was a little way he had . He said ,-- " When I don ' t see any little crabs on the shore , or sticking up out of the water , I usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water ; the little bubbles go _puff , puff , puff_ , and then they go _pop , pop , pop_ , and they show me where the little juicy crabs are , so I can put my paw in and catch them . I wonder if I shall see any little bubbles to - day ?" The old Alligator , lying low in the mud and weeds , heard this , and he thought , " Pooh ! _That ' s_	l
by herself , sometimes , and write thoughts in her diary ; all the little girls kept diaries . She liked to make up stories out of her own head , and sometimes she made verses . When the four little sisters had finished their lessons , and had helped their mother wash up and sew , they used to go to the big barn to play ; and the best play of all was theatricals . Louisa liked theatricals better than anything . They made the barn into a theatre , and the grown - up people came to	s
had apples and nuts to eat , in the happy land of home . Louisa loved all these plays , and she made some of her own and wrote them down so that the children could act them . But better than fun or writing Louisa loved her mother , and by and by , as the little girl began to grow into a big girl , she felt very sad to see her dear mother work so hard . She helped all she could with the housework , but nothing could really help the tired mother except money ; she needed money for food and clothes , and someone grown up , to help in the house . But there never was enough money for these things , and Louisa ' s mother grew more and more weary , and sometimes ill . I cannot tell you how much Louisa suffered over this . At last , as Louisa thought about it , she came to care more about helping her mother and her father and her sisters than about anything else in all the world . And she began to work very hard to earn money . She	l
sewed for people , and when she was a little older she taught some little girls their lessons , and then she wrote stories for the papers . Every bit of money she earned , except what she had to use , she gave to her dear family . It helped very much , but it was so little that Louisa never felt as if she were doing anything . Every year she grew more unselfish , and every year she worked harder . She liked writing stories best of all her work , but she did not get much	s
she was afterward . Maybe you would like to hear a poem she wrote about it , when she was only fourteen years old . It will help you , too , to think the same thoughts . A little kingdom I possess , Where thoughts and feelings dwell , And very hard I find the task Of governing it well ; For passion tempts and troubles me , A wayward will misleads , And selfishness its shadow casts On all my words and deeds . How can I learn to rule myself , To be the child I should	s
, Honest and brave , nor ever tire Of trying to be good ? How can I keep a sunny soul To shine along life ' s way ? How can I tune my little heart To sweetly sing all day ? Dear Father , help me with the love That casteth out my fear , Teach me to lean on Thee , and feel That Thou art very near , That no temptation is unseen , No childish grief too small , Since Thou , with patience infinite , Doth soothe and comfort all . I do not ask for any crown But that which all may win , Nor seek to conquer any world , Except the one within . Be Thou my Guide until I find , Led by a tender hand , Thy happy kingdom in _myself_ , And dare to take command . PICCOLA Poor , sweet Piccola ! Did you hear What happened to Piccola , children dear ? ' Tis seldom Fortune such favour grants As fell to this little maid of France . ' Twas Christmas - time , and her parents poor Could hardly drive the wolf from the door ,	l
nuts and pink , rosy balls and silver stars ; he had pretty little pink and white candles in his arms ; but last , and most wonderful of all , the children hung a beautiful white , floating doll - angel over his head ! The Little Fir Tree could not breathe , for joy and wonder . What was it that he was , now ? Why was this glory for him ? After a time every one went away and left him . It grew dusk , and the Little Fir Tree began to hear strange sounds	s
through the closed doors . Sometimes he heard a child crying . He was beginning to be lonely . It grew more and more shadowy . All at once , the doors opened and the two children came in . Two of the pretty ladies were with them . They came up to the Little Fir Tree and quickly lighted all the little pink and white candles . Then the two pretty ladies took hold of the table with the Little Fir Tree on it and pushed it , very smoothly and quickly , out of the doors , across a hall , and in at another door . The Little Fir Tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little white beds in it , of children propped up on pillows in the beds , and of other children in great wheeled chairs , and others hobbling about or sitting in little chairs . He wondered why all the little children looked so white and tired ; he did not know that he was in a hospital . But before he could wonder any more his breath was quite taken away by the shout those little	l
Oh , I am crying because I do not know how to keep the house ," said Elsa . " I cannot make bread , I cannot sweep , I cannot sew a seam ; when I was a little girl I never learned to work , and now I cannot do anything right . I wish I had ten good fairies to help me !" " You shall have them , dear ," said the grey man , and he shook his strange grey cloak . Pouf ! Out hopped ten tiny fairies , no bigger than that ! " These shall be your servants , Elsa ," said the grey man ; " they are faithful and clever , and they will do everything you want them to , just right . But the neighbours might stare and ask questions if they saw these little chaps running about your house , so I will hide them away for you . Give me your little useless hands ." Wondering , Elsa stretched out her pretty , little , white hands . " Now stretch out your little useless fingers , dear !" Elsa stretched out her pretty pink fingers	l
aloud . But as the clock struck two , the little creatures whisked away out of the window , and left the room all as it was before . The shoemaker and his wife looked at each other , and said , " How can we thank the little elves who have made us happy and prosperous ?" " I should like to make them some pretty clothes ," said the wife , " they are quite naked ." " I will make the shoes if you will make the coats ," said her husband . That very day they commenced their task . The wife cut out two tiny , tiny coats of green , two weeny , weeny waistcoats of yellow , two little pairs of trousers , of white , two bits of caps , bright red ( for every one knows the elves love bright colours ), and her husband made two little pairs of shoes with long , pointed toes . They made the wee clothes as dainty as could be , with nice little stitches and pretty buttons ; and by Christmas time , they were finished . On Christmas eve , the shoemaker	l
cleaned his bench , and on it , instead of leather , he laid the two sets of gay little fairy - clothes . Then he and his wife hid away as before , to watch . Promptly at midnight , the little naked elves came in . They hopped upon the bench ; but when they saw the little clothes there , they laughed and danced for joy . Each one caught up his little coat and things and began to put them on . Then they looked at each other and made all kinds of funny motions in	s
gong , so I danced . I forgot your children , and trod on them ." " I shall go to King Solomon ," said the Otter , " and you shall be punished ." Soon the Mouse - deer was called before King Solomon . " Did you kill the Otter ' s babies ?" said the king . " Yes , your Majesty ," said the Mouse - deer , " but I did not mean to ." " How did it happen ?" said the king . " Your Majesty knows ," said the Mouse - deer	s
Indeed I will ," said the Camel , who was very fond of sugar - cane . " Where is it ?" " It is on the other side of the river ," said the little Jackal ; " but we can manage it nicely , if you will take me on your back and swim over ." The Camel was perfectly willing , so the little Jackal jumped on his back , and the Camel swam across the river , carrying him . When they were safely over , the little Jackal jumped down and showed the Camel the sugar - cane field ; then he ran swiftly along the river bank , to hunt for crabs ; the Camel began to eat sugar - cane . He ate happily , and noticed nothing around him . Now , you know , a Camel is very big , and a Jackal is very little . Consequently , the little Jackal had eaten his fill by the time the Camel had barely taken a mouthful . The little Jackal had no mind to wait for his slow friend ; he wanted to be off home again , about his business	l
Oh , yes , I know the Nightingale very well . Every night , when I go to carry scraps from the kitchen to my mother , who lives in the wood beyond the forest , I hear the Nightingale sing ." The Chamberlain asked the maid to take him to the Nightingale ' s home , and many of the lords and ladies followed after . When they had gone a little way , they heard a cow moo . " Ah !" said the lords and ladies , " that must be the Nightingale ; what a large	s
greenwood , but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them . That evening the palace was all trimmed with the most beautiful flowers you can imagine , and rows and rows of little silver bells , that tinkled when the wind blew in , and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of wax candles , that shone like tiny stars . In the great hall there was a gold perch for the Nightingale , beside the Emperor ' s throne . When all the people were there , the Emperor asked the Nightingale to sing . Then	s
and ladies . " But it does not matter ; the new nightingale is just as good ." So the artificial nightingale was given the real Nightingale ' s little gold perch , and every night the Emperor wound her up , and she sang waltz tunes to him . The people in the court liked her even better than the old Nightingale , because they could all whistle her tunes ,-- which you can ' t do with real nightingales . About a year after the artificial nightingale came , the Emperor was listening to her waltz tune ,	s
, there were faces . Some were very , very ugly , and some were sweet and lovely ; they were all the things the Emperor had done in his life , good and bad . And as he looked at them they began to whisper . They whispered , " _Do you remember this ? _ " " _Do you remember that ? _ " The Emperor remembered so much that he cried out loud , " Oh , bring the great drum ! Make music , so that I may not hear these dreadful whispers !" But there was nobody there to bring the drum . Then the Emperor cried , " You little gold nightingale , can you not sing something for me ? I have given you gifts of gold and jewels , and kept you always by my side ; will you not help me now ?" But there was nobody to wind the little gold nightingale up , and of course it could not sing . The Emperor ' s heart grew colder and colder where Death crouched upon it , and the dreadful whispers grew louder and louder , and the Emperor '	l
man was jerked almost off his feet . But he only laughed , and said , " Tough piece of land ; it will be a lot better next year ." When he had ploughed , the man went back to his cart and unloaded another farm implement . This one was like a three - cornered platform of wood , with a long , curved , strong rake under it . It was called a harrow , and it looked like the diagram on the next page . The man harnessed the horses to it , and then he stood on the platform and drove all over the strip of land . It was fun to watch , but perhaps it was a little hard to do . The man ' s weight kept the harrow steady , and let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up , so that it did not stay in ridges . " He scrambles the ground , father !" said Margery . " It needs ' scrambling ,'" laughed her father . " We are going to get more weeds than we want on this fresh soil , and	l
it would make terribly hard weeding . He was not going to have any such thing for his two " little girls ," as he called them . So he gave that little garden particular attention . This is what he did . After he had thrown out all the turf , he shovelled clean earth on to the garden ,-- as much as three solid inches of it ; not a bit of grass was in that . Then it was ready for raking and fertilising , and for the lines . The little footpaths were marked out by Father Brown ' s feet ; Margery and her mother laughed well at his actions , for it looked like some kind of dance . Mr Brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy , and he did it very nicely : he walked along the sides of the square , with one foot turned a little out , and the other straight , taking such tiny steps that his feet touched each other all the time . This tramped out a path just wide enough for a person to walk . The wider path was	l
marked with lines and raked . Margery thought , of course , all the flowers would be put in as the vegetables were ; but she found that it was not so . For some , her father poked little holes with his finger ; for some , he made very shallow trenches ; and some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top of the ground . Margery and her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the arrangement of the flowers , that perhaps you will like to hear just how they designed that garden	s
had never seen anything more wonderful than the little round lettuce - seeds . They were so tiny that it did not seem possible that green lettuce leaves could come from them . But they surely would . Mother and father and Margery were late to supper that evening . But they were all so happy that it did not matter . The last thing Margery thought of , as she went to sleep at night , was the dear , smooth little garden , with its funny footpath , and with the little sticks standing at the ends of	s
workmen have to be very carefully trained , or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding . They have to be taught the difference between a birch tree and a weed ." " How funny !" said Margery , dimpling . " Yes , it sounds funny ," said father ; " but , you see , the birch tree is dicotyledonous , and so are many weeds , and the dicotyledons look so much alike at first ." " I am glad to know that , father ," said Margery , soberly . " I believe I shall learn a good deal from living in the country ; don ' t you think so ?" Margery ' s father took her in his arms . " I hope so , dear ," he said ; " the country is a good place for little girls ." And that was all that happened , that day . THE TALKATIVE TORTOISE Once upon a time , a Tortoise lived in a pond with two Ducks , who were her very good friends . She enjoyed the company of the Ducks , because she could talk with them	l
me behind !" begged the Tortoise . " Take me with you ; I must die if I am left here ." " But you cannot fly !" said the Ducks . " How can we take you with us ?" " Take me with you ! take me with you !" said the Tortoise . The Ducks felt so sorry for her that at last they thought of a way to take her . " We have thought of a way which will be possible ," they said , " if only you can manage to keep still long enough . We will each take hold of one end of a stout stick , and do you take the middle in your mouth ; then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us . But remember not to talk ! If you open your mouth , you are lost ." The Tortoise said she would not say a word ; she would not so much as move her mouth ; and she was very grateful . So the Ducks brought a strong little stick and took hold of the ends , while the	l
service ; his courtiers were about him , in their bright garments , and he himself was dressed in his royal robes . The choir was chanting the Latin service , and as the beautiful voices swelled louder , the king noticed one particular verse which seemed to be repeated again and again . He turned to a learned clerk at his side and asked what those words meant , for he knew no Latin . " They mean , ' He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and hath exalted them of low degree ,'" answered	s
King of Sicily welcome , and greeted him as his brother . In the midst of it , the jester broke through the crowd and threw himself before the Pope . " Look at me !" he cried ; " I am your brother , Robert of Sicily ! This man is an impostor , who has stolen my throne . I am Robert , the king !" The Pope looked at the poor jester with pity , but the Emperor of Allemaine turned to the King of Sicily , and said , " Is it not rather dangerous , brother , to keep a madman as jester ?" And again Robert was pushed back among the serving - men . It was Holy Week , and the king and the emperor , with all their trains , went every day to the great services in the cathedral . Something wonderful and holy seemed to make these services more beautiful than ever before . All the people of Rome felt it : it was as if the presence of an angel were there . Men thought of God , and felt His blessing on them . But no one knew	l
up in the public square of Duesseldorf , ready for the opening view . The Elector came on the appointed day , and with him came his favourite courtiers from the castle . Then the statue was unveiled . It was very beautiful ,-- so beautiful that the prince exclaimed in surprise . He could not look enough , and presently he turned to the artist and shook hands with him , like an old friend . " Herr Grupello ," he said , " you are a great artist , and this statue will make your fame even greater than it is ; the portrait of me is perfect !" When the courtiers heard this , and saw the friendly hand - shake , their jealousy of the artist was beyond bounds . Their one thought was , how could they safely do something to humiliate him . They dared not pick flaws in the portrait statue , for the prince had declared it perfect . But at last one of them said , with an air of great frankness , " Indeed , Herr Grupello , the portrait of his Royal Highness is perfect ; but permit me	l
do evil , it will prick you , to remind you . If you do not heed its warnings a worse thing will happen to you , for I shall become your enemy ." Then she vanished . Prince Cherry wore his ring , and said nothing to anyone of the fairy ' s gift . It did not prick him for a long time , because he was good and merry and happy . But Prince Cherry had been rather spoiled by his nurse when he was a child ; she had always said to him that when he should become king he could do exactly as he pleased . Now , after a while , he began to find out that this was not true , and it made him angry . The first time that he noticed that even a king could not always have his own way was on a day when he went hunting . It happened that he got no game . This put him in such a bad temper that he grumbled and scolded all the way home . The little gold ring began to feel tight and uncomfortable . When he reached	l
dog , if I choose ? What evil is there in that ?" A silver voice spoke in his ear : " The king of the land has a right to do good , but not evil ; you have been guilty of bad temper and of cruelty to - day ; see that you do better to - morrow ." The prince turned sharply , but no one was to be seen ; yet he recognised the voice as that of Fairy Candide . He followed her advice for a little , but presently he forgot , and the ring pricked him so sharply that his finger had a drop of blood on it . This happened again and again , for the prince grew more self - willed and headstrong every day ; he had some bad friends , too , who urged him on , in the hope that he would ruin himself and give them a chance to seize the throne . He treated his people carelessly and his servants cruelly , and everything he wanted he felt that he must have . The ring annoyed him terribly ; it was embarrassing for a king to	l
saw her , and loved her so much that he wanted at once to make her his queen . To his great astonishment , she refused . " Am I not pleasing to you ?" asked the prince in surprise . " You are very handsome , very charming , prince ," said Zelia ; " but you are not like the good king , your father ; I fear you would make me very miserable if I were your queen ." In a great rage , Prince Cherry ordered the young girl to be put in prison ; and the key of her dungeon he kept . He told one of his friends , a wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes , about the thing , and asked his advice . " Are you not king ?" said the bad friend . " May you not do as you will ? Keep the girl in a dungeon till she does as you command , and if she will not , sell her as a slave ." " But would it not be a disgrace for me to harm an innocent creature ?" said the prince .	l
" It would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects dared disobey you !" said the courtier . He had cleverly touched the prince ' s worst trait , his pride . Prince Cherry went at once to Zelia ' s dungeon , prepared to do this cruel thing . Zelia was gone . No one had the key save the prince himself ; yet she was gone . The only person who could have dared to help her , thought the prince , was his old tutor , Suliman , the only	s
he could kill the men and rescue her ! But he could do nothing except bark , and bite at the heels of the wicked men . That did not stop them ; they drove him off , with blows , and carried Zelia into a palace in the wood . Poor Cherry crouched by the steps , and watched . His heart was full of pity and rage . But suddenly he thought , " I was as bad as these men ; I myself put Zelia in prison , and would have treated her worse still , if I had not been prevented ." The thought made him so sorry and ashamed that he repented bitterly the evil he had done . Presently a window opened , and Cherry saw Zelia lean out and throw down a piece of meat . He seized it and was just going to devour it , when the old woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away and took him in her arms . " No , you shall not eat it , you poor little thing ," she said , " for every bit of food in that	l
two quite different kinds of people in Ireland : one set of people with long dark hair and dark eyes , called Fomorians -- they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when they fought -- and another race of people who were golden - haired and blue - eyed , and who carried short , blunt , heavy spears of dull metal . The golden - haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of high priest , who was called the Dagda . And this Dagda had a wonderful magic harp . The harp	s
chords . The harp answered with the magic Music of Tears . As the wailing harmony smote upon the air , the women of the Fomorians bowed their heads and wept bitterly , the strong men turned their faces aside , and the little children sobbed . Again the Dagda touched the strings , and this time the magic Music of Mirth leaped from the harp . And when they heard that Music of Mirth , the young warriors of the Fomorians began to laugh ; they laughed till the cups fell from their grasp , and the spears dropped	s
will not ," said the tailor ; " remain where you are until I come back , and I ' ll lift you up ." The tailor went forward next day , and the fox met him . " God save you ," said the fox . " God save you ," said the tailor . " Where are you going ?" said the fox . " I ' m going to Dublin , to try to make a court for the king ." " Would you make a place for me where I can hide ?" said the fox	s
it , and got the lion to go in under the plough so that he might see if he was any good as a ploughman . He placed the lion ' s tail in the hole he had made for it , and then clapped in a peg , and the lion was not able to draw out his tail again . " Loose me now ," said the lion , " and we ' ll fix ourselves and go ploughing ." The tailor said he would not loose him until he came back himself . He left him there then , and he came to Dublin . When he arrived , he engaged workmen and began to build the court . At the end of the day he had the workmen put a great stone on top of the work . When the great stone was raised up , the tailor put some sort of contrivance under it , that he might be able to throw it down as soon as the giants came near to it . The workpeople then went home , and the tailor went in hiding behind the big stone . When the darkness of	l
nearer to him ." " No !" says the lion , " but that ' s the very way he had , when he was making the plough that I was caught in . I ' ll go no nearer to him ." They all left him then and returned . The tailor and his wife came home to Galway . HOW THE SEA BECAME SALT This story was told long ago by our Northern forefathers who brought it with them in their dragon ships when they crossed the North Sea to settle in England . In those days men	s
stones and tell him of what use they were , since no one could grind with them . And after the wise men had looked closely at them and read the magic letters which were cut upon their edge , they said that the millstones were precious indeed , since they would grind out of nothing anything that the miller might wish . So King Frode sent messengers over the world to find for him two servants who would be strong enough to grind with the millstones , and after a long , long time his messengers found him two	s
stones moved round and round , Frode , who still stood by , heard one chant in a low , sing - song voice ,-- " I see a fire east of the town -- the curlews awake and sound a note of warning . A host approaches in haste , to burn the dwelling of the king ." And the next took up her song ,-- " No longer will Frode sit on his throne , and rule over rings of red gold and mighty millstones . Now must we grind with all our might -- and , behold ! red warriors come forth -- and revenge , and bloodshed , and ruin ." Then Frode shook from head to foot in his terror , for he heard the tramp of a mighty host of warriors advancing from the sea . And as he looked for a way of escape , the braces of the millstones broke with the strong grinding , and fell in two . And the whole world shook and trembled with the mighty shock of that breaking . But through the crash and din came the voices of the Giant - Maidens , loudly chanting	l
as the eye could see . It was a wonderful and beautiful castle , all glistening towers that gleamed like marble , and glancing windows that shone like crystal . The two young men looked at it eagerly , and longed to go nearer . Suddenly , out of the distance , something like a great butterfly , of white and gold , swept toward them . And when it came nearer , they saw that it was a most beautiful lady , robed in floating garments as fine as cobwebs and wearing on her head a crown so bright	s
in the cool moss , with his back against a tree . He had a lunch in his traveller ' s pouch , and he ate it comfortably . Then he felt drowsy from the heat and the early ride , so he pulled his hat over his eyes , and settled himself for a nap . " It will go all the better for a little rest ," he said . That _was_ a sleep ! He slept like the seven sleepers , and he dreamed the most beautiful things you could imagine . At last , he dreamed that he had entered the castle of fortune and was being received with great festivities . Everything he wanted was brought to him , and music played while fireworks were set off in his honour . The music was so loud that he awoke . He sat up , rubbing his eyes , and behold , the fireworks were the very last rays of the setting sun , and the music was the voice of the other traveller , passing the grove on foot ! " Time to be off ," said the lazy man , and looked about him	l
for the pretty horse . No horse was to be found . The only living thing near was an old , bony , grey donkey . The man called , and whistled , and looked , but no little horse appeared . After a long while he gave it up , and , since there was nothing better to do , he mounted the old grey donkey and set out again . The donkey was slow , and he was hard to ride , but he was better than nothing ; and gradually the lazy man saw the towers of	s
the castle draw nearer . Now it began to grow dark ; in the castle windows the lights began to show . Then came trouble ! Slower , and slower , went the grey donkey ; slower , and slower , till , in the very middle of a pitch - black wood , he stopped and stood still . Not a step would he budge for all the coaxing and scolding and beating his rider could give . At last the rider kicked him , as well as beat him , and at that the donkey felt that he had had enough . Up went his hind heels , and down went his head , and over it went the lazy man on to the stony ground . There he lay groaning for many minutes , for it was not a soft place , I can assure you . How he wished he were in a soft , warm bed , with his aching bones comfortable in blankets ! The very thought of it made him remember the Castle of Fortune , for he knew there must be fine beds there . To get to those beds he was	l
even willing to bestir his poor limbs , so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey . No donkey was to be found . The lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen , scratched his hands on the stumps , tore his face in the briers , and bumped his knees on the stones . But no donkey was there . He would have laid down to sleep again , but he could hear now the howls of hungry wolves in the woods ; that it did not sound pleasant . Finally	s
beast , and he saw what he was riding : it was a gigantic snail ! a snail as large as a calf ! A cold shudder ran over the lazy man ' s body , and he would have got off his horrid animal then and there , but just then the clock struck once more . It was the first of the long , slow strokes that mark midnight ! The man grew frantic when he heard it . He drove his heels into the snail ' s sides , to make him hurry . Instantly , the	s
turned himself about ; as it struck eight , he began to move backward , away from the castle ! The lazy man shouted , and beat him , but the beast went slowly backward . And the clock struck nine . The man tried to slide off , then , but from all sides of his strange animal great arms came reaching up and held him fast . And in the next ray of moonlight that broke the dark clouds , he saw that he was mounted on a monster crab ! One by one , the lights went	s
in the fields , far from home , watching over the sheep . He had to guard them from wild animals , and lead them to the right pastures , and care for them . By and by , war broke out between the people of David ' s country and a people that lived near at hand ; these men were called Philistines , and the people of David ' s country were named Israelites . All the strong men of Israel went up to the battle , to fight for their king . David ' s three older	s
came to the place where the Israelites were , just as the host was going forth to the fight , shouting for the battle . So he left his gifts in the hands of the keeper of the baggage , and ran into the army , amongst the soldiers , to find his brothers . When he found them , he saluted them and began to talk with them . But while he was asking them the questions his father had commanded , there arose a great shouting and tumult among the Israelites , and men came running back from	s
should defy the armies of the living God ?" And he was stirred with anger . Very soon , some of the officers told the king about the youth who was asking so many questions , and who said that it was shame upon Israel that a mere Philistine should defy the armies of the living God . Immediately Saul sent for him . When David came before Saul , he said to the king , " Let no man ' s heart fail because of him ; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine ." But Saul	s
And he armed David with his own armour ,-- he put a helmet of brass upon his head , and armed him with a coat of mail . But when David girded his sword upon his armour , and tried to walk , he said to Saul , " I cannot go with these , for I am not used to them ." And he put them off . Then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones out of the brook , and put them in a shepherd ' s bag which he	s
had ; and his sling was in his hand ; and he went out and drew near to the Philistine . And the Philistine came on and drew near to David ; and the man that bore his shield went before him . And when the Philistine looked about and saw David , he disdained him , for David was but a boy , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance . And he said to David , " Am I a dog , that thou comest to me with a cudgel ?" And with curses he cried out again , " Come to me , and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air , and to the beasts of the field ." But David looked at him , and answered , " Thou comest to me with a sword , and with a spear , and with a shield ; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts , the God of the armies of Israel , whom thou hast defied . This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand , and I will smite thee ,	l
in his heart . There was just one thing he cared about : it was to make his soul so pure and perfect that it could be one of the stones in God ' s great Temple of Heaven . One day , after the forty years , he had a great longing to know how far along he had got with his work ,-- how it looked to the Heavenly Father . And he prayed that he might be shown a man -- " Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown To the selfsame measure as his own ; Whose treasure on the celestial shore Could neither be less than his nor more ." As he looked up from his prayer , a white - robed angel stood in the path before him . The hermit bowed before the messenger with great gladness , for he knew that his wish was answered . " Go to the nearest town ," the angel said , " and there , in the public square , you will find a mountebank ( a clown ) making the people laugh for money . He is the man you seek ; his soul	l
has grown to the selfsame stature as your own ; his treasure on the celestial shore is neither less than yours nor more ." When the angel had faded from sight , the hermit bowed his head again , but this time with great sorrow and fear . Had his forty years of prayer been a terrible mistake , and was his soul indeed like a clown , fooling in the market - place ? He knew not what to think . Almost he hoped he should not find the man , and could believe that he had dreamed the	s
these signs of distress , and he thought , " Christmas will be here soon , and dear mother is thinking of what a sad time it will be ." What would Gottlieb have given to be able to comfort his mother ! He could only sit and brood , while his young heart swelled and a lump rose in his throat at the thought that he could do nothing . Presently , however , a happy fancy came to him . Was not the Christ Child born on Christmas Day , and did not He send good gifts to men on His birthday ? But then came the thought , " He will never find us . Our home is so mean and small ." It seemed foolish to hope , but a boy is not long cast down , and as Gottlieb sat dreaming , a happy inspiration came to him . Stealing softly from the room he took paper and pen , for he had learnt to write , and spelt out , word after word , a letter which he addressed to the Christ Child . You may be sure that the postman was puzzled what	l
to offer . Your needles would prick the wee Babe , and your tears are sticky ." This made the poor Fir very unhappy indeed , and it said , sadly , " Yes , you are right . I have nothing that would be good enough to offer to the Christ Child ." Now , quite near to the trees had stood an Angel , who had heard all that had passed . He was moved to pity the Fir , who was so lowly and without envy of the other trees , and he resolved to help it	s
" I ' ve been taught a lesson that I shall not easily forget . Yes , yes ! Simple worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesty and unselfishness -- and there is no _true_ beauty where these virtues are absent !" [ The Adventures of Buster Bear by Thornton W . Burgess 1920 ] I BUSTER BEAR GOES FISHING Buster Bear yawned as he lay on his comfortable bed of leaves and watched the first early morning sunbeams creeping through the Green Forest to chase out the Black Shadows . Once more he yawned , and slowly got to his feet and shook himself . Then he walked over to a big pine - tree , stood up on his hind legs , reached as high up on the trunk of the tree as he could , and scratched the bark with his great claws . After that he yawned until it seemed as if his jaws would crack , and then sat down to think what he wanted for breakfast . While he sat there , trying to make up his mind what would taste best , he was listening to the sounds that told	l
of the waking of all the little people who live in the Green Forest . He heard Sammy Jay way off in the distance screaming , " Thief ! Thief !" and grinned . " I wonder ," thought Buster , " if some one has stolen Sammy ' s breakfast , or if he has stolen the breakfast of some one else . Probably he is the thief himself ." He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding as fast as he could make his tongue go and working himself into a terrible rage . " Must be that Chatterer	s
Joe to come back and get it that Little Joe wouldn ' t dare do anything of the kind . " Where is he now ?" asked Billy Mink . " He ' s somewhere up the Laughing Brook . I wish he ' d fall in and get drowned !" snapped Little Joe . Billy Mink just had to laugh . The idea of great big Buster Bear getting drowned in the Laughing Brook was too funny . There wasn ' t water enough in it anywhere except down in the Smiling Pool , and that was on the Green Meadows , where Buster had never been known to go . " Let ' s go see what he is doing ," said Billy Mink . At first Little Joe didn ' t want to , but at last his curiosity got the better of his fear , and he agreed . So the two little brown - coated scamps turned down the Laughing Brook , taking the greatest care to keep out of sight themselves . They had gone only a little way when Billy Mink whispered : " Sh - h ! There he is ." Sure	l
a great rage . Billy Mink stopped long enough to eat the fat fish Buster had left on the bank and then he too went down to the Smiling Pool . When Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink reached the Smiling Pool , they climbed up on the Big Rock , and there Little Joe sulked and sulked , until finally Grandfather Frog asked what the matter was . Little Joe wouldn ' t tell , but Billy Mink told the whole story . When he told how Buster had been too smart for Little Joe , it tickled him	s
foolish trout to take his hook . But he didn ' t get so much as a nibble . " Either the trout have lost their appetite or they have grown very wise ," muttered Farmer Brown ' s boy , as after a long time he moved on to the next little pool . There the same thing happened . He was very patient , very , very patient , but his patience brought no reward , not so much as the faintest kind of a nibble . Farmer Brown ' s boy trudged on to the next pool	s
away that something had happened . " Hi !" cried Billy Mink . " Look at Little Joe Otter ! It must be that for once he has been smarter than Buster Bear ." Little Joe made a good - natured face at Billy Mink and shook his head . " No , Billy ," said he , " you are wrong , altogether wrong . I don ' t believe anybody can be smarter than Buster Bear ." [ Illustration : Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter . _Page 45 . _ ] Reddy Fox rolled his	s
drawled : " Farmer Brown ' s boy is afraid of Buster Bear ." For a minute no one said a word . Then Blacky the Crow leaned down from his perch in the Big Hickory - tree and looked very hard at Little Joe as he said : " I don ' t believe it . I don ' t believe a word of it . Farmer Brown ' s boy isn ' t afraid of any one who lives in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows or in the Smiling Pool , and you know it	s
. But they were still more afraid of Farmer Brown ' s boy , because they didn ' t know him or understand him , and because in the past he had tried to catch some of them in traps and had hunted some of them with his terrible gun . So now they were very proud to think that one of their own number actually had frightened him , and they began to look on Buster Bear as a real hero . They tried in ever so many ways to show him how friendly they felt and went quite	s
out of their way to do him favors . Whenever they met one another , all they could talk about was the smartness and the greatness of Buster Bear . " Now I guess Farmer Brown ' s boy will keep away from the Green Forest , and we won ' t have to be all the time watching out for him ," said Bobby Coon , as he washed his dinner in the Laughing Brook , for you know he is very neat and particular . " And he won ' t dare set any more traps for me ," gloated Billy Mink . " Ah wish Brer Bear would go up to Farmer Brown ' s henhouse and scare Farmer Brown ' s boy so that he would keep away from there . It would be a favor to me which Ah cert ' nly would appreciate ," said Unc ' Billy Possum when he heard the news . " Let ' s all go together and tell Buster Bear how much obliged we are for what he has done ," proposed Jerry Muskrat . " That ' s a splendid idea !" cried Little Joe Otter .	l
many sharp tricks that no one is really his friend unless it is that other mischief - maker , Sammy Jay , who , you know , is Blacky ' s cousin . But no one said anything , and Blacky went on . " Little Joe Otter has told us how he saw Farmer Brown ' s boy hurry home when he found the footprint of Buster Bear on the edge of the Laughing Brook , and how all the way he kept looking behind him , as if he were afraid . Perhaps he was , and then	s
again perhaps he wasn ' t . Perhaps he had something else on his mind . You have made a hero of Buster Bear , because you believe Little Joe ' s story . Now I don ' t say that I don ' t believe it , but I do say that I will be a lot more sure that Farmer Brown ' s boy is afraid of Buster when I see him run away myself . Now here is my plan : " To - morrow morning , very early , Sammy Jay and I will make a great fuss near the edge of the Green Forest . Farmer Brown ' s boy has a lot of curiosity , and he will be sure to come over to see what it is all about . Then we will lead him to where Buster Bear is . If he runs away , I will be the first to admit that Buster Bear is as great a hero as some of you seem to think he is . It is a very simple plan , and if you will all hide where you can watch , you will be able	l
S BOY AND BUSTER BEAR GROW CURIOUS Ever since it was light enough to see at all , Blacky the Crow had been sitting in the top of the tallest tree on the edge of the Green Forest nearest to Farmer Brown ' s house , and never for an instant had he taken his eyes from Farmer Brown ' s back door . What was he watching for ? Why , for Farmer Brown ' s boy to come out on his way to milk the cows . Meanwhile , Sammy Jay was slipping silently through the Green Forest , looking for Buster Bear , so that when the time came he could let his cousin , Blacky the Crow , know just where Buster was . By and by the back door of Farmer Brown ' s house opened , and out stepped Farmer Brown ' s boy . In each hand he carried a milk pail . Right away Blacky began to scream at the top of his lungs . " Caw , caw , caw !" shouted Blacky . " Caw , caw , caw !" And all the time he flew about among the trees	l
with a great deal of respect and were very proud of him . But now they had seen Buster Bear and Farmer Brown ' s boy meet face to face ; and while it was true that Farmer Brown ' s boy had run away as fast as ever he could , it was also true that Buster Bear had done the same thing . He had run even faster than Farmer Brown ' s boy , and had hidden in the most lonely place he could find in the very deepest part of the Green Forest . It was hard to believe , but it was true . And right away everybody lost a great deal of the respect for Buster which they had felt . It is always that way . They began to say unkind things about him . They said them among themselves , and some of them even said them to Buster when they met him , or said them so that he would hear them . Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay , who , because they can fly , have nothing to fear from Buster , and who always delight in	l
his teeth and glare up at them , but that was all he could do . He couldn ' t get at them . He just had to stand it and do nothing . But when impudent little Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted the same thing from a place just out of reach in a big pine - tree , Buster could stand it no longer . He gave a deep , angry growl that made little shivers run over Chatterer , and then suddenly he started up that tree after Chatterer . With a frightened little shriek Chatterer scampered to the top of the tree . He hadn ' t known that Buster could climb . But Buster is a splendid climber , especially when the tree is big and stout as this one was , and now he went up after Chatterer , growling angrily . How Chatterer did wish that he had kept his tongue still ! He ran to the very top of the tree , so frightened that his teeth chattered , and when he looked down and saw Buster ' s great mouth coming nearer and nearer , he nearly tumbled down with terror	l
. The worst of it was there wasn ' t another tree near enough for him to jump to . He was in trouble this time , was Chatterer , sure enough ! And there was no one to help him . XVI CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL JUMPS FOR HIS LIFE It isn ' t very often that Chatterer the Red Squirrel knows fear . That is one reason that he is so often impudent and saucy . But once in a while a great fear takes possession of him , as when he knows that Shadow the Weasel is	s
quite by itself , and Buster Bear _could_ climb ! Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble , and there was no one to blame but himself . That is usually the case with those who get into trouble . Nearer and nearer came Buster Bear , and deeper and angrier sounded his voice . Chatterer gave a little frightened gasp and looked this way and looked that way . What should he do ? What _could_ he do ! The ground seemed a terrible distance below . If only he had wings like Sammy Jay ! But he	s
habit becomes bad , if it is carried too far . Suppose you had a secret , a real secret , something that nobody else knew and that you didn ' t want anybody else to know . And suppose you had the habit of talking to yourself . You might , without thinking , you know , tell that secret out loud to yourself , and some one might , just might happen to overhear ! Then there wouldn ' t be any secret . That is the way that a habit which isn ' t bad in itself	s
he dreamed of berries and berry pies . He was awake even before jolly , round , red Mr . Sun thought it was time to get up , and he was all ready to start for the Old Pasture when the first Jolly Little Sunbeams came dancing across the Green Meadows . He carried a big tin pail , and in the bottom of it , wrapped up in a piece of paper , was a lunch , for he meant to stay until he filled that pail , if it took all day . Now the Old Pasture is very large . It lies at the foot of the Big Mountain , and even extends a little way up on the Big Mountain . There is room in it for many people to pick berries all day without even seeing each other , unless they roam about a great deal . You see , the bushes grow very thick there , and you cannot see very far in any direction . Jolly , round , red Mr . Sun had climbed a little way up in the sky by the time Farmer Brown ' s boy reached the	l
again --" Help ! Help ! Help "-- and it was very faint and sounded terribly frightened . He waited a minute or two , but heard nothing more . Then he put down his pail and began a hurried look here , there , and everywhere . He was sure that it had come from somewhere on the ground , so he peered behind bushes and peeped behind logs and stones , and then just as he had about given up hope of finding where it came from , he went around a little turn in the old cow	s
as he sat on his haunches stripping off the berries greedily . His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment , and he didn ' t mind at all if now and then he got leaves , and some green berries in his mouth with the big ripe berries . He didn ' t try to get them out . Oh , my , no ! He just chomped them all up together and patted his stomach from sheer delight . Now Buster had reached the Old Pasture just as jolly , round , red Mr . Sun had crept out of bed , and he had fully made up his mind that he would be back in the Green Forest before Mr . Sun had climbed very far up in the blue , blue sky . You see , big as he is and strong as he is , Buster Bear is very shy and bashful , and he has no desire to meet Farmer Brown , or Farmer Brown ' s boy , or any other of those two - legged creatures called men . It seems funny but he actually is afraid of them . And he had a	l
eat and eat . Now you know that Buster is a very big fellow , and it takes a lot to fill him up . He kept eating and eating and eating , and the more he ate the more he wanted . You know how it is . So he wandered from one patch of berries to another in the Old Pasture , and never once thought of the time . Somehow , time is the hardest thing in the world to remember , when you are having a good time . Jolly , round , red Mr . Sun climbed higher and higher in the blue , blue sky . He looked down on all the Great World and saw all that was going on . He saw Buster Bear in the Old Pasture , and smiled as he saw what a perfectly glorious time Buster was having . And he saw something else in the Old Pasture that made his smile still broader . He saw Farmer Brown ' s boy filling a great tin pail with blueberries , and he knew that Farmer Brown ' s boy didn ' t know that Buster Bear was anywhere	l
about , and he knew that Buster Bear didn ' t know that Farmer Brown ' s boy was anywhere about , and somehow he felt very sure that he would see something funny happen if they should chance to meet . " Um - m - m , um - m - m ," mumbled Buster Bear with his mouth full , as he moved along to another patch of berries . And then he gave a little gasp of surprise and delight . Right in front of him was a shiny thing just full of the finest ,	s
ears and caught there . This was bad enough , but to make matters worse , just at that very minute he heard a shrill , angry voice shout , " Hi , there ! Get out of there !" He didn ' t need to be told whose voice that was . It was the voice of Farmer Brown ' s boy . Right then and there Buster Bear nearly had a fit . There was that awful pail fast over his head so that he couldn ' t see a thing . Of course , that meant that	s
he couldn ' t run away , which was the thing of all things he most wanted to do , for big as he is and strong as he is , Buster is very shy and bashful when human beings are around . He growled and whined and squealed . He tried to back out of the pail and couldn ' t . He tried to shake it off and couldn ' t . He tried to pull it off , but somehow he couldn ' t get hold of it . Then there was another yell . If Buster hadn ' t been so frightened himself , he might have recognized that second yell as one of fright , for that is what it was . You see Farmer Brown ' s boy had just discovered Buster Bear . When he had yelled the first time , he had supposed that it was one of the young cattle who live in the Old Pasture all summer , but when he saw Buster , he was just as badly frightened as Buster himself . In fact , he was too surprised and frightened even to run . After that second	l
yell he just stood still and stared . Buster clawed at that awful thing on his head more frantically than ever . Suddenly it slipped off , so that he could see . He gave one frightened look at Farmer Brown ' s boy , and then with a mighty " Woof !" he started for the Green Forest as fast as his legs could take him , and this was very fast indeed , let me tell you . He didn ' t stop to pick out a path , but just crashed through the bushes as if they	s
known enough to keep my head out of it ," he said slowly and thoughtfully . " You got no more than you deserve for stealing Farmer Brown ' s boy ' s berries ," said Sammy Jay , who had come back and was looking on from the top of a tree . " You ought to know by this time that no good comes of stealing ." Buster Bear looked up and grinned , and there was a twinkle in his eyes . " You ought to know , Sammy Jay ," said he . " I hope	s
you ' ll always remember it ." " Thief , thief , thief !" screamed Sammy , and flew away . XXIII FARMER BROWN ' S BOY LUNCHES ON BERRIES When things go wrong in spite of you To smile ' s the best thing you can do -- To smile and say , " I ' m mighty glad They are no worse ; they ' re not so bad !" That is what Farmer Brown ' s boy said when he found that Buster Bear had stolen the berries he had worked so hard to pick and then had run off with the pail . You see , Farmer Brown ' s boy is learning to be something of a philosopher , one of those people who accept bad things cheerfully and right away see how they are better than they might have been . When he had first heard some one in the bushes where he had hidden his pail of berries , he had been very sure that it was one of the cows or young cattle who live in the Old Pasture during the summer . He had been afraid that they might stupidly kick	l
back . " If he is so afraid of me , I guess I needn ' t be afraid of him ," said he . " I ' ve lost my berries , but it is worth it to find out that he is afraid of me . There are plenty more on the bushes , and all I ' ve got to do is to pick them . It might be worse ." He walked over to the place where the pail had been , and then he remembered that when Buster ran away he had carried the pail with him , hanging about his neck . He whistled . It was a comical little whistle of chagrin as he realized that he had nothing in which to put more berries , even if he picked them . " It ' s worse than I thought ," cried he . " That bear has cheated me out of that berry pie my mother promised me ." Then he began to laugh , as he thought of how funny Buster Bear had looked with the pail about his neck , and then because , you know he is learning to	l
. Then , instead of growing angry , a slow smile stole over his freckled face . " I guess some one else was hungry too ," he muttered . " Wonder who it was ? Guess this Old Pasture is no place for me to - day . I ' ll fill up on berries and then I ' ll go home ." So Farmer Brown ' s boy made his lunch on blueberries and then rather sheepishly he started for home to tell of all the strange things that had happened to him in the Old Pasture .	s
mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ), whether the pleasure of making a daisy - chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her . There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself , ' Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be late !' ( when she thought	s
couldn ' t answer either question , it didn ' t much matter which way she put it . She felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , ' Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ?' when suddenly , thump ! thump ! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over . Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . There was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it ' s getting !' She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but	l
* * * * * * * * * * * ' What a curious feeling !' said Alice ; ' I must be shutting up like a telescope .' And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden . First , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; ' for it might end , you know ,' said Alice to herself , ' in my going out altogether , like a candle . I wonder what I should be like then ?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing . After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! when she got to the door , she	l
it ' s a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror .' ( For , with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened .) So she began again : ' Ou est ma chatte ?' which was the first sentence in her French lesson - book . The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright . ' Oh , I beg your pardon !' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal	s
that it was not easy to know when the race was over . However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out ' The race is over !' and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , ' But who has won ?' This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him ), while the rest waited in silence . At last the Dodo said , ' EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes .' ' But who is to give the prizes ?' quite a chorus of voices asked . ' Why , SHE , of course ,' said the Dodo , pointing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused way , ' Prizes ! Prizes !' Alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her	l
herself in a melancholy tone . ' Nobody seems to like her , down here , and I ' m sure she ' s the best cat in the world ! Oh , my dear Dinah ! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more !' And here poor Alice began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low - spirited . In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story . CHAPTER IV . The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ; and she heard it muttering to itself ' The Duchess ! The Duchess ! Oh my dear paws ! Oh my fur and whiskers ! She ' ll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets ! Where CAN I have dropped them , I wonder ?' Alice guessed in a	l
here ? Run home this moment , and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan ! Quick , now !' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the mistake it had made . ' He took me for his housemaid ,' she said to herself as she ran . ' How surprised he ' ll be when he finds out who I am ! But I ' d better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if I can find them .' As she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ' W . RABBIT ' engraved upon it . She went in without knocking , and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann , and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves . ' How queer it seems ,' Alice said to herself , ' to be going messages for a rabbit ! I suppose Dinah '	l
down the bottle , saying to herself ' That ' s quite enough -- I hope I shan ' t grow any more -- As it is , I can ' t get out at the door -- I do wish I hadn ' t drunk quite so much !' Alas ! it was too late to wish that ! She went on growing , and growing , and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this , and she tried the effect of lying down with one	s
as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself , and fanned herself with one of the leaves : ' I should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if -- if I ' d only been the right size to do it ! Oh dear ! I ' d nearly forgotten that I ' ve got to grow up again ! Let me see -- how IS it to be managed ? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ?' The great question certainly was ,	s
an eel on the end of your nose -- What made you so awfully clever ?' ' I have answered three questions , and that is enough ,' Said his father ; ' don ' t give yourself airs ! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ? Be off , or I ' ll kick you down stairs !' ' That is not said right ,' said the Caterpillar . ' Not QUITE right , I ' m afraid ,' said Alice , timidly ; ' some of the words have got altered .' '	s
, which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her . ' What CAN all that green stuff be ?' said Alice . ' And where HAVE my shoulders got to ? And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can ' t see you ?' She was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves . As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head , she tried to get her head down to them , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent . She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops	l
of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings . ' Serpent !' screamed the Pigeon . ' I ' m NOT a serpent !' said Alice indignantly . ' Let me alone !' ' Serpent , I say again !' repeated the Pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , ' I ' ve tried every way , and nothing	s
' A likely story indeed !' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt . ' I ' ve seen a good many little girls in my time , but never ONE with such a neck as that ! No , no ! You ' re a serpent ; and there ' s no use denying it . I suppose you ' ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg !' ' I HAVE tasted eggs , certainly ,' said Alice , who was a very truthful child ; ' but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know .' ' I don ' t believe it ,' said the Pigeon ; ' but if they do , why then they ' re a kind of serpent , that ' s all I can say .' This was such a new idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding , ' You ' re looking for eggs , I know THAT well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you ' re	l
a little girl or a serpent ?' ' It matters a good deal to ME ,' said Alice hastily ; ' but I ' m not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I shouldn ' t want YOURS : I don ' t like them raw .' ' Well , be off , then !' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest . Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches	s
livery came running out of the wood --( she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery : otherwise , judging by his face only , she would have called him a fish )-- and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles . It was opened by another footman in livery , with a round face , and large eyes like a frog ; and both footmen , Alice noticed , had powdered hair that curled all over their heads . She felt very curious to know what it was all about , and crept a little way out of the wood to listen . The Fish - Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter , nearly as large as himself , and this he handed over to the other , saying , in a solemn tone , ' For the Duchess . An invitation from the Queen to play croquet .' The Frog - Footman repeated , in the same solemn tone , only changing the order of the words a little , ' From the Queen . An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet .' Then they both bowed	l
low , and their curls got entangled together . Alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the Fish - Footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky . Alice went timidly up to the door , and knocked . ' There ' s no sort of use in knocking ,' said the Footman , ' and that for two reasons . First , because	s
the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear . ' Please would you tell me ,' said Alice , a little timidly , for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first , ' why your cat grins like that ?' ' It ' s a Cheshire cat ,' said the Duchess , ' and that ' s why . Pig !' She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby , and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again :-- ' I didn ' t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I didn ' t know that cats COULD grin .' ' They all can ,' said the Duchess ; ' and most of ' em do .' ' I don ' t know of any that do ,' Alice said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation . ' You don ' t know much ,' said	l
the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : ' Twenty - four hours , I THINK ; or is it twelve ? I --' ' Oh , don ' t bother ME ,' said the Duchess ; ' I never could abide figures !' And with that she began nursing her child again , singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so , and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line : ' Speak roughly to	s
shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , ' just like a star - fish ,' thought Alice . The poor little thing was snorting like a steam - engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it . As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it , ( which was to twist it up into a sort	s
of knot , and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself ,) she carried it out into the open air . ' IF I don ' t take this child away with me ,' thought Alice , ' they ' re sure to kill it in a day or two : wouldn ' t it be murder to leave it behind ?' She said the last words out loud , and the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ). ' Don ' t grunt ,' said Alice ; ' that ' s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself .' The baby grunted again , and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it . There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn - up nose , much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby : altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all . ' But perhaps it was only sobbing	l
what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ?' when it grunted again , so violently , that she looked down into its face in some alarm . This time there could be NO mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a pig , and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further . So she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood . ' If it had grown up ,' she said to herself , ' it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , I think .' And she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , ' if one only knew the right way to change them --' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off . The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice . It looked good - natured , she	l
did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself ' Suppose it should be raving mad after all ! I almost wish I ' d gone to see the Hatter instead !' CHAPTER VII . A Mad Tea - Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it :	s
concert given by the Queen of Hearts , and I had to sing " Twinkle , twinkle , little bat ! How I wonder what you ' re at !" You know the song , perhaps ?' ' I ' ve heard something like it ,' said Alice . ' It goes on , you know ,' the Hatter continued , ' in this way :-- " Up above the world you fly , Like a tea - tray in the sky . Twinkle , twinkle --"' Here the Dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its sleep '	s
what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : ' But why did they live at the bottom of a well ?' ' Take some more tea ,' the March Hare said to Alice , very earnestly . ' I ' ve had nothing yet ,' Alice replied in an offended tone , ' so I can ' t take more .' ' You mean you can ' t take LESS ,' said the Hatter : ' it ' s very easy to take MORE than	s
these three little sisters -- they were learning to draw , you know --' ' What did they draw ?' said Alice , quite forgetting her promise . ' Treacle ,' said the Dormouse , without considering at all this time . ' I want a clean cup ,' interrupted the Hatter : ' let ' s all move one place on .' He moved on as he spoke , and the Dormouse followed him : the March Hare moved into the Dormouse ' s place , and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare . The	s
was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and	s
, as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed . The players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while , and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion , and went stamping about , and shouting ' Off with his head !' or ' Off with her head !' about once in a minute . Alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen , but she knew that it might happen any minute , ' and then ,' thought she , ' what would become of me ? They ' re dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is , that there ' s any one left alive !' She was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air :	l
HIS time of life . The King ' s argument was , that anything that had a head could be beheaded , and that you weren ' t to talk nonsense . The Queen ' s argument was , that if something wasn ' t done about it in less than no time she ' d have everybody executed , all round . ( It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious .) Alice could think of nothing else to say but ' It belongs to the Duchess : you ' d better ask HER about it .' ' She ' s in prison ,' the Queen said to the executioner : ' fetch her here .' And the executioner went off like an arrow . The Cat ' s head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game . CHAPTER IX . The Mock Turtle '	l
on rather better now ,' she said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little . '' Tis so ,' said the Duchess : ' and the moral of that is --" Oh , ' tis love , ' tis love , that makes the world go round !"' ' Somebody said ,' Alice whispered , ' that it ' s done by everybody minding their own business !' ' Ah , well ! It means much the same thing ,' said the Duchess , digging her sharp little chin into Alice ' s shoulder as she added , ' and the moral of THAT is --" Take care of the sense , and the sounds will take care of themselves ."' ' How fond she is of finding morals in things !' Alice thought to herself . ' I dare say you ' re wondering why I don ' t put my arm round your waist ,' the Duchess said after a pause : ' the reason is , that I ' m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo . Shall I try the experiment ?' ' HE might bite ,' Alice cautiously replied , not	l
they came nearer , Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break . She pitied him deeply . ' What is his sorrow ?' she asked the Gryphon , and the Gryphon answered , very nearly in the same words as before , ' It ' s all his fancy , that : he hasn ' t got no sorrow , you know . Come on !' So they went up to the Mock Turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears , but said nothing . ' This here young lady ,'	s
said : ' advance twice , set to partners --' '-- change lobsters , and retire in same order ,' continued the Gryphon . ' Then , you know ,' the Mock Turtle went on , ' you throw the --' ' The lobsters !' shouted the Gryphon , with a bound into the air . '-- as far out to sea as you can --' ' Swim after them !' screamed the Gryphon . ' Turn a somersault in the sea !' cried the Mock Turtle , capering wildly about . ' Change lobsters again !' yelled the Gryphon	s
? " You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea !" But the snail replied " Too far , too far !" and gave a look askance -- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance . '" What matters it how far we go ?" his scaly friend replied . " There is another shore , you know , upon the other side . The further off from England the nearer is to France -- Then turn not pale , beloved snail , but come and join the dance . Will you , won ' t you , will you , won ' t you , will you join the dance ? Will you , won ' t you , will you , won ' t you , won ' t you join the dance ?"' ' Thank	l
them , and considered a little before she gave her answer . ' They ' re done with blacking , I believe .' ' Boots and shoes under the sea ,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice , ' are done with a whiting . Now you know .' ' And what are they made of ?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity . ' Soles and eels , of course ,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently : ' any shrimp could have told you that .' ' If I ' d been the whiting ,' said Alice , whose thoughts were still running on the song , ' I ' d have said to the porpoise , " Keep back , please : we don ' t want YOU with us !"' ' They were obliged to have him with them ,' the Mock Turtle said : ' no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise .' ' Wouldn ' t it really ?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise . ' Of course not ,' said the Mock Turtle : ' why , if a fish came to ME , and	l
little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all . However , ' jury - men ' would have done just as well . The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates . ' What are they doing ?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon . ' They can ' t have anything to put down yet , before the trial ' s begun .' ' They ' re putting down their names ,' the Gryphon whispered in reply , ' for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial .' ' Stupid things !' Alice began in a loud , indignant voice , but she stopped hastily , for the White Rabbit cried out , ' Silence in the court !' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round , to make out who was talking . Alice could see , as well as if she were looking over their shoulders , that all the jurors were writing down ' stupid things !' on their slates , and she could even make out that one of them didn ' t know how to spell ' stupid ,' and that	l
s Evidence ' Here !' cried Alice , quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes , and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury - box with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before . ' Oh , I BEG your pardon !' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began picking them up again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury - box , or they would die . ' The trial cannot proceed ,' said the King in a very grave voice , ' until all the jurymen are back in their proper places -- ALL ,' he repeated with great emphasis , looking hard at Alice as he said do	l
. Alice looked at the jury - box , and saw that , in her haste , she had put the Lizard in head downwards , and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way , being quite unable to move . She soon got it out again , and put it right ; ' not that it signifies much ,' she said to herself ; ' I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other .' As soon as the jury had a little	s
as we needn ' t try to find any . And yet I don ' t know ,' he went on , spreading out the verses on his knee , and looking at them with one eye ; ' I seem to see some meaning in them , after all . "-- SAID I COULD NOT SWIM --" you can ' t swim , can you ?' he added , turning to the Knave . The Knave shook his head sadly . ' Do I look like it ?' he said . ( Which he certainly did NOT , being made entirely of cardboard .) ' All right , so far ,' said the King , and he went on muttering over the verses to himself : '" WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE --" that ' s the jury , of course --" I GAVE HER ONE , THEY GAVE HIM TWO --" why , that must be what he did with the tarts , you know --' ' But , it goes on " THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU ,"' said Alice . ' Why , there they are !' said the King triumphantly , pointing	l
man shall be as innocent as the daisies , as innocent and as cruel -- here the intellect ----" " There seems ," said Michael , timidly , " to be something sticking up in the middle of it ." " So there is ," said the Professor , leaning over the side of the ship , his spectacles shining with intellectual excitement . " What can it be ? It might of course be merely a ----" Then a shriek indescribable broke out of him of a sudden , and he flung up his arms like a lost spirit . The monk took the helm in a tired way ; he did not seem much astonished for he came from an ignorant part of the world in which it is not uncommon for lost spirits to shriek when they see the curious shape which the Professor had just seen on the top of the mysterious ball , but he took the helm only just in time , and by driving it hard to the left he prevented the flying ship from smashing into St . Paul ' s Cathedral . A plain of sad - coloured cloud lay along	l
the level of the top of the Cathedral dome , so that the ball and the cross looked like a buoy riding on a leaden sea . As the flying ship swept towards it , this plain of cloud looked as dry and definite and rocky as any grey desert . Hence it gave to the mind and body a sharp and unearthly sensation when the ship cut and sank into the cloud as into any common mist , a thing without resistance . There was , as it were , a deadly shock in the fact that there was	s
said the monk , looking wistfully into the void . Lucifer made an angry movement and opened his mouth to speak , but Michael , with all his air of deliberation , was proceeding before he could bring out a word . " I once knew a man like you , Lucifer ," he said , with a maddening monotony and slowness of articulation . " He took this ----" " There is no man like me ," cried Lucifer , with a violence that shook the ship . " As I was observing ," continued Michael , " this	s
that there is no such place as Eden . We find you saying that there is no such place as Ireland . You start by hating the irrational and you come to hate everything , for everything is irrational and so ----" Lucifer leapt upon him with a cry like a wild beast ' s . " Ah ," he screamed , " to every man his madness . You are mad on the cross . Let it save you ." And with a herculean energy he forced the monk backwards out of the reeling car on to the upper	s
part of the stone ball . Michael , with as abrupt an agility , caught one of the beams of the cross and saved himself from falling . At the same instant Lucifer drove down a lever and the ship shot up with him in it alone . " Ha ! ha !" he yelled , " what sort of a support do you find it , old fellow ?" " For practical purposes of support ," replied Michael grimly , " it is at any rate a great deal better than the ball . May I ask if you are going to leave me here ?" " Yes , yes . I mount ! I mount !" cried the professor in ungovernable excitement . " _Altiora peto_ . My path is upward ." " How often have you told me , Professor , that there is really no up or down in space ?" said the monk . " I shall mount up as much as you will ." " Indeed ," said Lucifer , leering over the side of the flying ship . " May I ask what you are going to do ?" The monk pointed downward	l
is to be found in such a saying as " The meek shall inherit the earth ." But those who see and feel the fundamental fact of the matter know that paradox is a thing which belongs not to religion only , but to all vivid and violent practical crises of human living . This kind of paradox may be clearly perceived by anybody who happens to be hanging in mid - space , clinging to one arm of the Cross of St . Paul ' s . Father Michael in spite of his years , and in spite of his asceticism ( or because of it , for all I know ), was a very healthy and happy old gentleman . And as he swung on a bar above the sickening emptiness of air , he realized , with that sort of dead detachment which belongs to the brains of those in peril , the deathless and hopeless contradiction which is involved in the mere idea of courage . He was a happy and healthy old gentleman and therefore he was quite careless about it . And he felt as every man feels in the taut moment of such	l
indifferent face , and a prosaic sort of uniform , with a row of buttons , blocked his way . Michael had no mind to wonder whether this solid astonished man , with the brown moustache and the nickel buttons , had also come on a flying ship . He merely let his mind float in an endless felicity about the man . He thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever . He thought how he would luxuriate in the nameless shades of this man '	s
eyes encountered the monkish habit of Michael , and he pulled off his grey tam - o '- shanter with the gesture of a Catholic . " Father , did you see what they said ?" he cried , trembling . " Did you see what they dared to say ? I didn ' t understand it at first . I read it half through before I broke the window ." Michael felt he knew not how . The whole peace of the world was pent up painfully in his heart . The new and childlike world which he had seen so suddenly , men had not seen at all . Here they were still at their old bewildering , pardonable , useless quarrels , with so much to be said on both sides , and so little that need be said at all . A fierce inspiration fell on him suddenly ; he would strike them where they stood with the love of God . They should not move till they saw their own sweet and startling existence . They should not go from that place till they went home embracing like brothers and shouting like men delivered .	l
that he asked violently , as for the last time , how the statement " God is Spirit " could be reconciled with the statement " The earth is His footstool ." It was in vain that he cried with an accusing energy that the Bishop of London was paid L12 , 000 a year for pretending to believe that the whale swallowed Jonah . It was in vain that he hung in conspicuous places the most thrilling scientific calculations about the width of the throat of a whale . Was it nothing to them all they that passed by	s
upon them . It made him feel as if he were moving in a world of idiots . He seemed among a race of men who smiled when told of their own death , or looked vacantly at the Day of Judgement . Year after year went by , and year after year the death of God in a shop in Ludgate became a less and less important occurrence . All the forward men of his age discouraged Turnbull . The socialists said he was cursing priests when he should be cursing capitalists . The artists said that the soul	s
form of Psa , occurs in an early legend which describes how the deity , after the manner of Jupiter on so many occasions , seduced a Virgin and begat a hero . This hero , whose name is not essential to our existence , was , it was said , the chief hero and Saviour of the Mesopotamian ethical scheme . Then followed a paragraph giving other examples of such heroes and Saviours being born of some profligate intercourse between God and mortal . Then followed a paragraph -- but Evan did not understand it . He read it	s
like a boy ; he saw a new youth opening before him . And as not unfrequently happens to middle - aged gentlemen when they see a new youth opening before them , he found himself in the presence of the police . The policemen , after some ponderous questionings , collared both the two enthusiasts . They were more respectful , however , to the young man who had smashed the window , than to the miscreant who had had his window smashed . There was an air of refined mystery about Evan MacIan , which did not exist	s
only wished to say , your worship ," said MacIan , putting back the purse in his trouser pocket , " that smashing that shop window was , I confess , a useless and rather irregular business . It may be excused , however , as a mere preliminary to further proceedings , a sort of preface . Wherever and whenever I meet that man ," and he pointed to the editor of _The Atheist_ , " whether it be outside this door in ten minutes from now , or twenty years hence in some distant country , wherever and whenever I meet that man , I will fight him . Do not be afraid . I will not rush at him like a bully , or bear him down with any brute superiority . I will fight him like a gentleman ; I will fight him as our fathers fought . He shall choose how , sword or pistol , horse or foot . But if he refuses , I will write his cowardice on every wall in the world . If he had said of my mother what he said of the Mother of God , there is	l
eyes , a square red tie and a square red beard , that he carried aggressively forward as if he defied anyone to pull it . The other kept so much in the background in comparison that he looked almost ghostly in his grey cloak or plaid , a tall , sallow , silent young man . The two Scotchmen were interested in seventeenth - century swords . They were fastidious about them . They had a whole armoury of these weapons brought out and rolled clattering about the counter , until they found two of precisely the same length . Presumably they desired the exact symmetry for some decorative trophy . Even then they felt the points , poised the swords for balance and bent them in a circle to see that they sprang straight again ; which , for decorative purposes , seems carrying realism rather far . " These will do ," said the strange person with the red beard . " And perhaps I had better pay for them at once . And as you are the challenger , Mr . MacIan , perhaps you had better explain the situation ." The tall Scotchman in grey	l
be so kind as to take us into your little garden and see far play , we shall feel how ----" The shopman recovered himself from a stunning surprise and burst out : " Gentlemen , are you drunk ? A duel ! A duel in my garden . Go home , gentlemen , go home . Why , what did you quarrel about ?" " We quarrelled ," said Evan , in the same dead voice , " about religion ." The fat shopkeeper rolled about in his chair with enjoyment . " Well , this is a funny game ," he said . " So you want to commit murder on behalf of religion . Well , well my religion is a little respect for humanity , and ----" " Excuse me ," cut in Turnbull , suddenly and fiercely , pointing towards the pawnbroker ' s next door . " Don ' t you own that shop ?" " Why -- er -- yes ," said Gordon . " And don ' t you own that shop ?" repeated the secularist , pointing backward to the pornographic bookseller . " What if I do ?" " Why	l
him on his back on the floor . " There ' s nothing very strong here ," said Evan , looking about him . " I ' m afraid he ' ll work through that gag in half an hour or so ." " Yes ," said Turnbull , " but one of us will be killed by that time ." " Well , let ' s hope so ," said the Highlander , glancing doubtfully at the squirming thing on the floor . " And now ," said Turnbull , twirling his fiery moustache and fingering his sword ,	s
I beg your pardon ," said MacIan , dryly . " Let us begin ." MacIan made a military salute with his weapon , which Turnbull copied or parodied with an impatient contempt ; and in the stillness of the garden the swords came together with a clear sound like a bell . The instant the blades touched , each felt them tingle to their very points with a personal vitality , as if they were two naked nerves of steel . Evan had worn throughout an air of apathy , which might have been the stale apathy of one	s
who wants nothing . But it was indeed the more dreadful apathy of one who wants something and will care for nothing else . And this was seen suddenly ; for the instant Evan engaged he disengaged and lunged with an infernal violence . His opponent with a desperate promptitude parried and riposted ; the parry only just succeeded , the riposte failed . Something big and unbearable seemed to have broken finally out of Evan in that first murderous lunge , leaving him lighter and cooler and quicker upon his feet . He fell to again , fiercely still , but now with a fierce caution . The next moment Turnbull lunged ; MacIan seemed to catch the point and throw it away from him , and was thrusting back like a thunderbolt , when a sound paralysed him ; another sound beside their ringing weapons . Turnbull , perhaps from an equal astonishment , perhaps from chivalry , stopped also and forebore to send his sword through his exposed enemy . " What ' s that ?" asked Evan , hoarsely . A heavy scraping sound , as of a trunk being dragged along a littered floor ,	l
came from the dark shop behind them . " The old Jew has broken one of his strings , and he ' s crawling about ," said Turnbull . " Be quick ! We must finish before he gets his gag out ." " Yes , yes , quick ! On guard !" cried the Highlander . The blades crossed again with the same sound like song , and the men went to work again with the same white and watchful faces . Evan , in his impatience , went back a little to his wildness . He made windmills	s
of what he was up to , but an instinct of discipline , inherited from a hundred men of war , made him stick to his own part and trust the other man ' s . " Open the doors , cabby ," he repeated , with something of the obstinate solemnity of a drunkard , " open the doors . Did ye no hear me say St . Pancras Station ?" The top of a policeman ' s helmet appeared above the garden wall . The cabman did not see it , but he was still suspicious and began : " Very sorry , sir , but ..." and with that the catlike Turnbull tore him out of his seat and hurled him into the street below , where he lay suddenly stunned . " Give me his hat ," said Turnbull in a silver voice , that the other obeyed like a bugle . " And get inside with the swords ." And just as the red and raging face of a policeman appeared above the wall , Turnbull struck the horse with a terrible cut of the whip and the two went whirling away like a boomerang	l
to complain of me if I have deferred until this moment a consultation with you on our present position or future action . Our present position , Mr . MacIan , I imagine that I am under no special necessity of describing . We have broken the law and we are fleeing from its officers . Our future action is a thing about which I myself entertain sufficiently strong views ; but I have no right to assume or to anticipate yours , though I may have formed a decided conception of your character and a decided notion of what they will probably be . Still , by every principle of intellectual justice , I am bound to ask you now and seriously whether you wish to continue our interrupted relations ." MacIan leant his white and rather weary face back upon the cushions in order to speak up through the open door . " Mr . Turnbull ," he said , " I have nothing to add to what I have said before . It is strongly borne in upon me that you and I , the sole occupants of this runaway cab , are at this moment the	l
away with such stunning promptitude that the police chase had in all probability not even properly begun . But in case it had , the amateur cabman chose his dizzy course through London with a strange dexterity . He did not do what would have first occurred to any ordinary outsider desiring to destroy his tracks . He did not cut into by - ways or twist his way through mean streets . His amateur common sense told him that it was precisely the poor street , the side street , that would be likely to remember and report the passing of a hansom cab , like the passing of a royal procession . He kept chiefly to the great roads , so full of hansoms that a wilder pair than they might easily have passed in the press . In one of the quieter streets Evan put on his boots . Towards the top of Albany Street the singular cabman again opened the trap . " Mr . MacIan ," he said , " I understand that we have now definitely settled that in the conventional language honour is not satisfied . Our action must at least go further	l
IV . A DISCUSSION AT DAWN The duellists had from their own point of view escaped or conquered the chief powers of the modern world . They had satisfied the magistrate , they had tied the tradesman neck and heels , and they had left the police behind . As far as their own feelings went they had melted into a monstrous sea ; they were but the fare and driver of one of the million hansoms that fill London streets . But they had forgotten something ; they had forgotten journalism . They had forgotten that there exists in	s
the modern world , perhaps for the first time in history , a class of people whose interest is not that things should happen well or happen badly , should happen successfully or happen unsuccessfully , should happen to the advantage of this party or the advantage of that part , but whose interest simply is that things should happen . It is the one great weakness of journalism as a picture of our modern existence , that it must be a picture made up entirely of exceptions . We announce on flaring posters that a man has fallen off a scaffolding . We do not announce on flaring posters that a man has not fallen off a scaffolding . Yet this latter fact is fundamentally more exciting , as indicating that that moving tower of terror and mystery , a man , is still abroad upon the earth . That the man has not fallen off a scaffolding is really more sensational ; and it is also some thousand times more common . But journalism cannot reasonably be expected thus to insist upon the permanent miracles . Busy editors cannot be expected to put on their posters , "	l
transformation of this common and incredible London man , this workman on a tram in Battersea , his clerk on an omnibus in Cheapside ? Turnbull , as he stared drearily , murmured to himself the words of the old atheistic and revolutionary Swinburne who had intoxicated his youth : " And still we ask if God or man Can loosen thee Lazarus ; Bid thee rise up republican , And save thyself and all of us . But no disciple ' s tongue can say If thou can ' st take our sins away ." Turnbull shivered slightly as if behind the earthly morning he felt the evening of the world , the sunset of so many hopes . Those words were from " Songs before Sunrise ". But Turnbull ' s songs at their best were songs after sunrise , and sunrise had been no such great thing after all . Turnbull shivered again in the sharp morning air . MacIan was also gazing with his face towards the city , but there was that about his blind and mystical stare that told one , so to speak , that his eyes were turned inwards . When Turnbull	l
We must often sleep under the stars as if we were in Africa . Last and most important we must not dream of effecting our -- our final settlement , which will be a thing as famous as the Phoenix Park murders , unless we have made real and precise arrangements for our isolation -- I will not say our safety . We must not , in short , fight until we have thrown them off our scent , if only for a moment . For , take my word for it , Mr . MacIan , if the British	s
. We may be able to get fifty or sixty miles away without even walking into an inn door . I have the biscuits and the tinned meat , and the milk . You have the chocolate , I think ? And the brandy ?" " Yes ," said MacIan , like a soldier taking orders . " Very well , then , come on . March . We turn under that third bush and so down into the valley ." And he set off ahead at a swinging walk . Then he stopped suddenly ; for he realized that	s
the other was not following . Evan MacIan was leaning on his sword with a lowering face , like a man suddenly smitten still with doubt . " What on earth is the matter ?" asked Turnbull , staring in some anger . Evan made no reply . " What the deuce is the matter with you ?" demanded the leader , again , his face slowly growing as red as his beard ; then he said , suddenly , and in a more human voice , " Are you in pain , MacIan ?" " Yes ," replied the Highlander , without lifting his face . " Take some brandy ," cried Turnbull , walking forward hurriedly towards him . " You ' ve got it ." " It ' s not in the body ," said MacIan , in his dull , strange way . " The pain has come into my mind . A very dreadful thing has just come into my thoughts ." " What the devil are you talking about ?" asked Turnbull . MacIan broke out with a queer and living voice . " We must fight now , Turnbull . We must fight	l
. " You confounded fool ," repeated Turnbull . " Put that thing up again , you ass ; people will come out of that house at the first clash of the steel ." " One of us will be dead before they come ," said the other , hoarsely , " for this is the hour God meant ." " Well , I never thought much of God ," said the editor of _The Atheist_ , losing all patience . " And I think less now . Never mind what God meant . Kindly enlighten my pagan darkness as to what the devil _you_ mean ." " The hour will soon be gone . In a moment it will be gone ," said the madman . " It is now , now , now that I must nail your blaspheming body to the earth -- now , now that I must avenge Our Lady on her vile slanderer . Now or never . For the dreadful thought is in my mind ." " And what thought ," asked Turnbull , with frantic composure , " occupies what you call your mind ?" " I must kill you now ,"	l
said the fanatic , " because ----" " Well , because ," said Turnbull , patiently . " Because I have begun to like you ." Turnbull ' s face had a sudden spasm in the sunlight , a change so instantaneous that it left no trace behind it ; and his features seemed still carved into a cold stare . But when he spoke again he seemed like a man who was placidly pretending to misunderstand something that he understood perfectly well . " Your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form ," he began , but MacIan broke	s
feel if you had drawn your sword , and I had run away from it . I should feel that because I had been weak , justice had not been done ." " Justice ," answered Turnbull , with a thoughtful smile , " but we are talking about your feelings . And what do you mean by justice , apart from your feelings ?" MacIan made a gesture of weary recognition ! " Oh , Nominalism ," he said , with a sort of sigh , " we had all that out in the twelfth century ." " I wish we could have it out now ," replied the other , firmly . " Do you really mean that if you came to think me right , you would be certainly wrong ?" " If I had a blow on the back of my head , I might come to think you a green elephant ," answered MacIan , " but have I not the right to say now , that if I thought that I should think wrong ?" " Then you are quite certain that it would be wrong to like me ?" asked Turnbull , with	l
and idle ." " And you are quite certain , I suppose ," continued Turnbull , " that if even you esteem me the esteem would be wholly animal and idle ?" For the first time MacIan started as if he had not expected the thing that was said to him . At last he said : " Whatever in earth or heaven it is that has joined us two together , it seems to be something which makes it impossible to lie . No , I do not think that the movement in me towards you was ... was that surface sort of thing . It may have been something deeper ... something strange . I cannot understand the thing at all . But understand this and understand it thoroughly , if I loved you my love might be divine . No , it is not some trifle that we are fighting about . It is not some superstition or some symbol . When you wrote those words about Our Lady , you were in that act a wicked man doing a wicked thing . If I hate you it is because you have hated goodness . And if	l
each other in the little garden behind the dealer ' s shop . There was a pause , and then MacIan made a movement as if to thrust , and almost at the same moment Turnbull suddenly and calmly dropped his sword . Evan stared round in an unusual bewilderment , and then realized that a large man in pale clothes and a Panama hat was strolling serenely towards them . V . THE PEACEMAKER When the combatants , with crossed swords , became suddenly conscious of a third party , they each made the same movement . It was as quick as the snap of a pistol , and they altered it instantaneously and recovered their original pose , but they had both made it , they had both seen it , and they both knew what it was . It was not a movement of anger at being interrupted . Say or think what they would , it was a movement of relief . A force within them , and yet quite beyond them , seemed slowly and pitilessly washing away the adamant of their oath . As mistaken lovers might watch the inevitable sunset of first love	l
this is a serious matter ," he said , eyeing Turnbull and MacIan , as if they had just been keeping the table in a roar with their frivolities . " I am sure that if I appealed to your higher natures ... your higher natures . Every man has a higher nature and a lower nature . Now , let us put the matter very plainly , and without any romantic nonsense about honour or anything of that sort . Is not bloodshed a great sin ?" " No ," said MacIan , speaking for the first time .	s
. On guard !'" The swords caught on each other with a dreadful clang and jar , full of the old energy and hate ; and at once plunged and replunged . Once more each man ' s heart had become the magnet of a mad sword . Suddenly , furious as they were , they were frozen for a moment motionless . " What noise is that ?" asked the Highlander , hoarsely . " I think I know ," replied Turnbull . " What ?... What ?" cried the other . " The student of Shaw and Tolstoy has made up his remarkable mind ," said Turnbull , quietly . " The police are coming up the hill ." VI . THE OTHER PHILOSOPHER Between high hedges in Hertfordshire , hedges so high as to create a kind of grove , two men were running . They did not run in a scampering or feverish manner , but in the steady swing of the pendulum . Across the great plains and uplands to the right and left of the lane , a long tide of sunset light rolled like a sea of ruby , lighting up the long	l
Unless what ?" repeated the Highlander . " Unless they do -- what they have done . Listen ." MacIan slackened his trot , and turned his head to the trail they had left behind them . Across two or three billows of the up and down lane came along the ground the unmistakable throbbing of horses ' hoofs . " They have put the mounted police on us ," said Turnbull , shortly . " Good Lord , one would think we were a Revolution ." " So we are ," said MacIan calmly . " What shall we do ? Shall we turn on them with our points ?" " It may come to that ," answered Turnbull , " though if it does , I reckon that will be the last act . We must put it off if we can ." And he stared and peered about him between the bushes . " If we could hide somewhere the beasts might go by us ," he said . " The police have their faults , but thank God they ' re inefficient . Why , here ' s the very thing . Be quick and quiet	l
of an express train . " I ought to tell you ," continued MacIan , still staring stolidly at the other , " that you are a great chief , and it is good to go to war behind you ." Turnbull said nothing , but turned and looked out of the foolish lattice of the little windows , then he said , " We must have food and sleep first ." When the last echo of their eluded pursuers had died in the distant uplands , Turnbull began to unpack the provisions with the easy air of a man	s
his hand out and caught one of the swords . " Let us fight at once ," he cried , " it is the end of the world ." " You ' re overdone , MacIan ," said Turnbull , putting him on one side . " It ' s only someone playing the goat . Let me open the door ." But he also picked up a sword as he stepped to open it . He paused one moment with his hand on the handle and then flung the door open . Almost as he did so the ferrule	s
cried the stranger in a high shrill voice , brandishing his cane defensively . " Let me see ," said Turnbull , looking round to MacIan with the same blandness . " Who are we ?" " Come out ," screamed the little man with the stick . " Certainly ," said Turnbull , and went outside with the sword , MacIan following . Seen more fully , with the evening light on his face , the strange man looked a little less like a goblin . He wore a square pale - grey jacket suit , on which the	s
Stop !" roared the little man in the butterfly necktie . " Put me out of my intellectual misery . Are you really the two tomfools I have read of in all the papers ? Are you the two people who wanted to spit each other in the Police Court ? Are you ? Are you ?" " Yes ," said MacIan , " it began in a Police Court ." The little man slung the bottle of wine twenty yards away like a stone . " Come up to my place ," he said . " I ' ve got better stuff than that . I ' ve got the best Beaune within fifty miles of here . Come up . You ' re the very men I wanted to see ." Even Turnbull , with his typical invulnerability , was a little taken aback by this boisterous and almost brutal hospitality . " Why ... sir ..." he began . " Come up ! Come in !" howled the little man , dancing with delight . " I ' ll give you a dinner . I ' ll give you a bed ! I ' ll give you	l
curiosity of a child , " excuse me , but ..." " Well ?" said the small fighter , brandishing his wooden weapon . " Excuse me ," repeated MacIan , " but was that what you were doing at the door ?" The little man stared an instant and then said : " Yes ," and Turnbull broke into a guffaw . " Come on !" cried the little man , tucking his stick under his arm and taking quite suddenly to his heels . " Come on ! Confound me , I ' ll see both of you eat and then I ' ll see one of you die . Lord bless me , the gods must exist after all -- they have sent me one of my day - dreams ! Lord ! A duel !" He had gone flying along a winding path between the borders of the kitchen garden , and in the increasing twilight he was as hard to follow as a flying hare . But at length the path after many twists betrayed its purpose and led abruptly up two or three steps to the door of a tiny but very clean cottage	l
. You have found your way , gentlemen , by a beautiful accident , to the house of the only man in England ( probably ) who will favour and encourage your most reasonable project . From Cornwall to Cape Wrath this county is one horrible , solid block of humanitarianism . You will find men who will defend this or that war in a distant continent . They will defend it on the contemptible ground of commerce or the more contemptible ground of social good . But do not fancy that you will find one other person who will	s
will be the conqueror . When it has been done , nothing will alter it . Heroes , I give you the hospitality fit for heroes . And I salute the survivor . Fall on !" The two men took their swords . Then MacIan said steadily : " Mr . Turnbull , lend me your sword a moment ." Turnbull , with a questioning glance , handed him the weapon . MacIan took the second sword in his left hand and , with a violent gesture , hurled it at the feet of little Mr . Wimpey . "	s
for it ," replied Turnbull . " Perhaps it is the South Sea Islands , or it may be Magdalen College ." There was a long pause , and MacIan also lifted his large limbs off the ground -- his eyes particularly dreamy . " I know what you mean , Turnbull ," he said , " but ... I always thought you people agreed with all that ." " With all that about doing as one likes , and the individual , and Nature loving the strongest , and all the things which that cockroach talked about ." Turnbull ' s big blue - grey eyes stood open with a grave astonishment . " Do you really mean to say , MacIan ," he said , " that you fancied that we , the Free - thinkers , that Bradlaugh , or Holyoake , or Ingersoll , believe all that dirty , immoral mysticism about Nature ? Damn Nature !" " I supposed you did ," said MacIan calmly . " It seems to me your most conclusive position ." " And you mean to tell me ," rejoined the other , " that you broke my window ,	l
and challenged me to mortal combat , and tied a tradesman up with ropes , and chased an Oxford Fellow across five meadows -- all under the impression that I am such an illiterate idiot as to believe in Nature !" " I supposed you did ," repeated MacIan with his usual mildness ; " but I admit that I know little of the details of your belief -- or disbelief ." Turnbull swung round quite suddenly , and set off towards the village . " Come along ," he cried . " Come down to the village . Come	s
down to the nearest decent inhabitable pub . This is a case for beer ." " I do not quite follow you ," said the Highlander . " Yes , you do ," answered Turnbull . " You follow me slap into the inn - parlour . I repeat , this is a case for beer . We must have the whole of this matter out thoroughly before we go a step farther . Do you know that an idea has just struck me of great simplicity and of some cogency . Do not by any means let us drop our intentions of settling our differences with two steel swords . But do you not think that with two pewter pots we might do what we really have never thought of doing yet -- discover what our difference is ?" " It never occurred to me before ," answered MacIan with tranquillity . " It is a good suggestion ." And they set out at an easy swing down the steep road to the village of Grassley - in - the - Hole . Grassley - in - the - Hole was a rude parallelogram of buildings , with two	l
, a post office , a gentleman ' s garden with very high hedges , a microscopically small public house , and two cottages . Where all the people lived who supported all the public houses was in this , as in many other English villages , a silent and smiling mystery . The church lay a little above and beyond the village , with a square grey tower dominating it decisively . But even the church was scarcely so central and solemn an institution as the large public house , the Valencourt Arms . It was named after some splendid family that had long gone bankrupt , and whose seat was occupied by a man who had invented a hygienic bootjack ; but the unfathomable sentimentalism of the English people insisted in regarding the Inn , the seat and the sitter in it , as alike parts of a pure and marmoreal antiquity . And in the Valencourt Arms festivity itself had some solemnity and decorum ; and beer was drunk with reverence , as it ought to be . Into the principal parlour of this place entered two strangers , who found themselves , as is always the	l
what the original nature of things would have been if things had not interfered with it . The first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it ; it was interfering with nature , if there is any nature . The first wild ox began to tear up the grass and eat it ; he was interfering with nature , if there is any nature . In the same way ," continued Turnbull , " the human when it asserts its dominance over nature is just as natural as the thing which it destroys ." "	s
thing under a ceiling at all . Come outside ! Come outside and ascend into heaven !" He burst the door open on a blue abyss of evening and they stepped out into it : it was suddenly and strangely cool . " Turnbull ," said MacIan , " you have said some things so true and some so false that I want to talk ; and I will try to talk so that you understand . For at present you do not understand at all . We don ' t seem to mean the same things by the same words ." He stood silent for a second or two and then resumed . " A minute or two ago I caught you out in a real contradiction . At that moment logically I was right . And at that moment I knew I was wrong . Yes , there is a real difference between the natural and the supernatural : if you flew up into that blue sky this instant , I should think that you were moved by God -- or the devil . But if you want to know what I really think ... I must explain	l
. I don ' t want no votin ' nor priests . I say a man ' s a man ; that ' s what I say . If a man a ' n ' t a man , what is he ? That ' s what I say , if a man a ' n ' t a man , what is he ? When I sees a man , I sez ' e ' s a man ." " Quite so ," said Turnbull , " a citizen ." " I say he ' s a man ," said the rustic furiously , stopping and striking his stick on the ground . " Not a city or owt else . He ' s a man ." " You ' re perfectly right ," said the sudden voice of MacIan , falling like a sword . " And you have kept close to something the whole world of today tries to forget ." " Good night ." And the old man went on wildly singing into the night . " A jolly old creature ," said Turnbull ; " he didn ' t seem able to get much beyond	l
himself into replying to them with a hot intellectual enjoyment . " I begin to understand one or two of your dogmas , Mr . Turnbull ," he had said emphatically as they ploughed heavily up a wooded hill . " And every one that I understand I deny . Take any one of them you like . You hold that your heretics and sceptics have helped the world forward and handed on a lamp of progress . I deny it . Nothing is plainer from real history than that each of your heretics invented a complete cosmos of his own which the next heretic smashed entirely to pieces . Who knows now exactly what Nestorius taught ? Who cares ? There are only two things that we know for certain about it . The first is that Nestorius , as a heretic , taught something quite opposite to the teaching of Arius , the heretic who came before him , and something quite useless to James Turnbull , the heretic who comes after . I defy you to go back to the Free - thinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all . I defy	l
The second is the Catholic Church ." " Physical science and the Catholic Church !" said Turnbull sarcastically ; " and no doubt the first owes a great deal to the second ." " If you pressed that point I might reply that it was very probable ," answered MacIan calmly . " I often fancy that your historical generalizations rest frequently on random instances ; I should not be surprised if your vague notions of the Church as the persecutor of science was a generalization from Galileo . I should not be at all surprised if , when you counted the scientific investigations and discoveries since the fall of Rome , you found that a great mass of them had been made by monks . But the matter is irrelevant to my meaning . I say that if you want an example of anything which has progressed in the moral world by the same method as science in the material world , by continually adding to without unsettling what was there before , then I say that there _is_ only one example of it . And that is Us ." " With this enormous difference ," said Turnbull ,	l
on earth that can perpetuate a type of virtue and make it something more than a fashion . The thing is so plain and historical that I hardly think you will ever deny it . You cannot deny that it is perfectly possible that tomorrow morning , in Ireland or in Italy , there might appear a man not only as good but good in exactly the same way as St . Francis of Assisi . Very well , now take the other types of human virtue ; many of them splendid . The English gentleman of Elizabeth was chivalrous	s
you dislike him it is not because you are a nice ordinary man , but because you are ( if you will excuse me ) a sophisticated prig of a Fleet Street editor . That is just the funny part of it . The human race has always admired the Catholic virtues , however little it can practise them ; and oddly enough it has admired most those of them that the modern world most sharply disputes . You complain of Catholicism for setting up an ideal of virginity ; it did nothing of the kind . The whole human race set up an ideal of virginity ; the Greeks in Athene , the Romans in the Vestal fire , set up an ideal of virginity . What then is your real quarrel with Catholicism ? Your quarrel can only be , your quarrel really only is , that Catholicism has _achieved_ an ideal of virginity ; that it is no longer a mere piece of floating poetry . But if you , and a few feverish men , in top hats , running about in a street in London , choose to differ as to the ideal itself ,	l
from all this human experience , does it never strike you that it may be Fleet Street that is wrong ?" " No ," answered Turnbull ; " I trust that I am sufficiently fair - minded to canvass and consider the idea ; but having considered it , I think Fleet Street is right , yes -- even if the Parthenon is wrong . I think that as the world goes on new psychological atmospheres are generated , and in these atmospheres it is possible to find delicacies and combinations which in other times would have to be represented by some ruder symbol . Every man feels the need of some element of purity in sex ; perhaps they can only typify purity as the absence of sex . You will laugh if I suggest that we may have made in Fleet Street an atmosphere in which a man can be so passionate as Sir Lancelot and as pure as Sir Galahad . But , after all , we have in the modern world erected many such atmospheres . We have , for instance , a new and imaginative appreciation of children ." " Quite so ," replied MacIan	l
Turnbull must have been more superstitious than he knew , for he stopped in the act of going forward . MacIan was brazenly superstitious , and he dropped his sword . After all , he had challenged the universe to send an interruption ; and this was an interruption , whatever else it was . An instant afterwards the sharp , weak cry was repeated . This time it was certain that it was human and that it was female . MacIan stood rolling those great blue Gaelic eyes that contrasted with his dark hair . " It is the voice of God ," he said again and again . " God hasn ' t got much of a voice ," said Turnbull , who snatched at every chance of cheap profanity . " As a matter of fact , MacIan , it isn ' t the voice of God , but it ' s something a jolly sight more important -- it is the voice of man -- or rather of woman . So I think we ' d better scoot in its direction ." MacIan snatched up his fallen weapon without a word , and the two raced	l
away towards that part of the distant road from which the cry was now constantly renewed . They had to run over a curve of country that looked smooth but was very rough ; a neglected field which they soon found to be full of the tallest grasses and the deepest rabbit - holes . Moreover , that great curve of the countryside which looked so slow and gentle when you glanced over it , proved to be highly precipitous when you scampered over it ; and Turnbull was twice nearly flung on his face . MacIan , though much	s
defend himself . By his side sat a young lady . She was sitting bolt upright , a slender and rigid figure gripping the sides of her seat , and her first few cries had ceased . She was clad in close - fitting dark costume , a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves on each side of her forehead ; and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort , like a young falcon hardly free of the nest . Turnbull had concealed	s
the interruption , turned upon Turnbull and began a battering bout of fisticuffs . At the same moment the man crawled out of the ditch in a masquerade of mud and rushed at his old enemy from behind . The whole had not taken a second ; and an instant after MacIan was in the midst of them . Turnbull had tossed away his sheathed sword , greatly preferring his hands , except in the avowed etiquette of the duel ; for he had learnt to use his hands in the old street - battles of Bradlaugh . But to MacIan the sword even sheathed was a more natural weapon , and he laid about him on all sides with it as with a stick . The man who had the walking - stick found his blows parried with promptitude ; and a second after , to his great astonishment , found his own stick fly up in the air as by a conjuring trick , with a turn of the swordsman ' s wrist . Another of the revellers picked the stick out of the ditch and ran in upon MacIan , calling to his companion to assist him	l
white moonlight on the road , when he was not looking at it , gave him a vision of the road being white with snow . The motor - car , when he was not looking at it , gave him a rude impression of a captured coach in the old days of highwaymen . And he whose whole soul was with the swords and stately manners of the eighteenth century , he who was a Jacobite risen from the dead , had an overwhelming sense of being once more in the picture , when he had so long been out of the picture . In that short and strong silence he absorbed the lady from head to foot . He had never really looked at a human being before in his life . He saw her face and hair first , then that she had long suede gloves ; then that there was a fur cap at the back of her brown hair . He might , perhaps , be excused for this hungry attention . He had prayed that some sign might come from heaven ; and after an almost savage scrutiny he came to the conclusion that	l
four or five visible facts , as a curtain hangs on four of five fixed nails . The fact that the lady had a little fur at her throat ; the fact that the curve of her cheek was a low and lean curve and that the moonlight caught the height of her cheek - bone ; the fact that her hands were small but heavily gloved as they gripped the steering - wheel ; the fact that a white witch light was on the road ; the fact that the brisk breeze of their passage stirred and fluttered a little not only the brown hair of her head but the black fur on her cap . All these facts were to him certain and incredible , like sacraments . When they had driven half a mile farther , a big shadow was flung across the path , followed by its bulky owner , who eyed the car critically but let it pass . The silver moonlight picked out a piece or two of pewter ornament on his blue uniform ; and as they went by they knew it was a sergeant of police . Three hundred yards farther on	l
backs bellowing , and was in its turn left behind . Avenues of poplars on both sides of the road chased each other like the figures in a zoetrope . Now and then with a shock and rattle they went through sleeping moonlit villages , which must have stirred an instant in their sleep as at the passing of a fugitive earthquake . Sometimes in an outlying house a light in one erratic , unexpected window would give them a nameless hint of the hundred human secrets which they left behind them with their dust . Sometimes even a slouching rustic would be afoot on the road and would look after them , as after a flying phantom . But still MacIan stood up staring at earth and heaven ; and still the door he had flung open flapped loose like a flag . Turnbull , after a few minutes of dumb amazement , had yielded to the healthiest element in his nature and gone off into uncontrollable fits of laughter . The girl had not stirred an inch . After another half mile that seemed a mere flash , Turnbull leant over and locked the door . Evan staggered	l
of a tower or tree against it and knew that it was already grey . Save that they were driving southward and had certainly passed the longitude of London , they knew nothing of their direction ; but Turnbull , who had spent a year on the Hampshire coast in his youth , began to recognize the unmistakable but quite indescribable villages of the English south . Then a white witch fire began to burn between the black stems of the fir - trees ; and , like so many things in nature , though not in books on evolution , the daybreak , when it did come , came much quicker than one would think . The gloomy heavens were ripped up and rolled away like a scroll , revealing splendours , as the car went roaring up the curve of a great hill ; and above them and black against the broadening light , there stood one of those crouching and fantastic trees that are first signals of the sea . X . THE SWORDS REJOINED As they came over the hill and down on the other side of it , it is not too much to say	l
only the horrid irony of your own empty head and empty heart . I am to give to the unfortunate , when my whole misfortune is that I have nothing to give . I am to teach , when I believe nothing at all that I was taught . I am to save the children from death , and I am not even certain that I should not be better dead . I suppose if I actually saw a child drowning I should save it . But that would be from the same motive from which I have saved you	s
, or destroyed you , whichever it is that I have done ." " What was the motive ?" asked Evan , in a low voice . " My motive is too big for my mind ," answered the girl . Then , after a pause , as she stared with a rising colour at the glittering sea , she said : " It can ' t be described , and yet I am trying to describe it . It seems to me not only that I am unhappy , but that there is no way of being happy . Father is not happy , though he is a Member of Parliament ----" She paused a moment and added with a ghost of a smile : " Nor Aunt Mabel , though a man from India has told her the secret of all creeds . But I may be wrong ; there may be a way out . And for one stark , insane second , I felt that , after all , you had got the way out and that was why the world hated you . You see , if there were a way out , it would	l
stage of this downward journey , there closed over their heads living bridges and caverns of the most varied foliage , all of which grew greener , redder , or more golden , in the growing sunlight of the morning . Life , too , of the more moving sort rose at the sun on every side of them . Birds whirred and fluttered in the undergrowth , as if imprisoned in green cages . Other birds were shaken up in great clouds from the tree - tops , as if they were blossoms detached and scattered up to heaven . Animals which Turnbull was too much of a Londoner and MacIan too much of a Northerner to know , slipped by among the tangle or ran pattering up the tree - trunks . Both the men , according to their several creeds , felt the full thunder of the psalm of life as they had never heard it before ; MacIan felt God the Father , benignant in all His energies , and Turnbull that ultimate anonymous energy , that _Natura Naturans_ , which is the whole theme of Lucretius . It was down this clamorous ladder of life	l
; nobody ever comes there at all ." And picking up his sword again , he began striding towards a big bluff of the rocks which stood out upon their left . MacIan followed him round the corner and found himself in what was certainly an even finer fencing court , of flat , firm sand , enclosed on three sides by white walls of rock , and on the fourth by the green wall of the advancing sea . " We are quite safe here ," said Turnbull , and , to the other ' s surprise , flung himself down , sitting on the brown beach . " You see , I was brought up near here ," he explained . " I was sent from Scotland to stop with my aunt . It is highly probable that I may die here . Do you mind if I light a pipe ?" " Of course , do whatever you like ," said MacIan , with a choking voice , and he went and walked alone by himself along the wet , glistening sands . Ten minutes afterwards he came back again , white with his own whirlwind of	l
breeches . I ' ll not fight foul for all the girls and angels in the universe ." " Will you oblige me ," said Turnbull , with staring grey eyes and a voice of distinct and violent politeness ; " will you oblige me by jolly well minding your own business ? Just you stand up and fight , and we ' ll see who will be washed away like seaweed . You wanted to finish this fight and you shall finish it , or I ' ll denounce you as a coward to the whole of that assembled	s
company ." Evan looked very doubtful and offered a somewhat wavering weapon ; but he was quickly brought back to his senses by his opponent ' s sword - point , which shot past him , shaving his shoulder by a hair . By this time the waves were well up Turnbull ' s thigh , and what was worse , they were beginning to roll and break heavily around them . MacIan parried this first lunge perfectly , the next less perfectly ; the third in all human probability he would not have parried at all ; the Christian champion would have been pinned like a butterfly , and the atheistic champion left to drown like a rat , with such consolation as his view of the cosmos afforded him . But just as Turnbull launched his heaviest stroke , the sea , in which he stood up to his hips , launched a yet heavier one . A wave breaking beyond the others smote him heavily like a hammer of water . One leg gave way , he was swung round and sucked into the retreating sea , still gripping his sword . MacIan put his sword between	l
on a low , green swell , with the sword still in his teeth and the editor of _The Atheist_ still under his arm . What he was going to do he had not even the most glimmering idea ; so he merely kept his grip and swam somehow with one hand . He ducked instinctively as there bulked above him a big , black wave , much higher than any that he had seen . Then he saw that it was hardly the shape of any possible wave . Then he saw that it was a fisherman ' s boat , and , leaping upward , caught hold of the bow . The boat pitched forward with its stern in the air for just as much time as was needed to see that there was nobody in it . After a moment or two of desperate clambering , however , there were two people in it , Mr . Evan MacIan , panting and sweating , and Mr . James Turnbull , uncommonly close to being drowned . After ten minutes ' aimless tossing in the empty fishing - boat he recovered , however , stirred , stretched himself	l
aimlessly all night , came within sight of land , though of land which looked almost as lost and savage as the waves . All night there had been but little lifting in the leaden sea , only now and then the boat had been heaved up , as on a huge shoulder which slipped from under it ; such occasional sea - quakes came probably from the swell of some steamer that had passed it in the dark ; otherwise the waves were harmless though restless . But it was piercingly cold , and there was , from time to time , a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray , which seemed almost to freeze as it fell . MacIan , more at home than his companion in this quite barbarous and elemental sort of adventure , had rowed toilsomely with the heavy oars whenever he saw anything that looked like land ; but for the most part had trusted with grim transcendentalism to wind and tide . Among the implements of their first outfit the brandy alone had remained to him , and he gave it to his freezing companion in quantities which greatly alarmed	l
only one arm now and seemed to be shouting directions . At the same moment a mass of blue blocked the corner of the road behind the small , smart figure of Turnbull , and a small company of policemen in the English uniform came up at a kind of half - military double . Turnbull saw the stare of consternation in his enemy ' s face and swung round to share its cause . When he saw it , cool as he was , he staggered back . " What the devil are you doing here ?" he called out in a high , shrill voice of authority , like one who finds a tramp in his own larder . " Well , sir ," said the sergeant in command , with that sort of heavy civility shown only to the evidently guilty , " seems to me we might ask what are you doing here ?" " We are having an affair of honour ," said Turnbull , as if it were the most rational thing in the world . " If the French police like to interfere , let them interfere . But why the blue blazes	l
well , because you see , sir , this ain ' t France . This is His Majesty ' s dominions , same as ' Ampstead ' eath ." " Not France ?" repeated Turnbull , with a sort of dull incredulity . " No , sir ," said the sergeant ; " though most of the people talk French . This is the island called St . Loup , sir , an island in the Channel . We ' ve been sent down specially from London , as you were such specially distinguished criminals , if you ' ll allow me to say so . Which reminds me to warn you that anything you say may be used against you at your trial ." " Quite so ," said Turnbull , and lurched suddenly against the sergeant , so as to tip him over the edge of the road with a crash into the shingle below . Then leaving MacIan and the policemen equally and instantaneously nailed to the road , he ran a little way along it , leapt off on to a part of the beach , which he had found in his journey to be firmer	l
, and went across it with a clatter of pebbles . His sudden calculation was successful ; the police , unacquainted with the various levels of the loose beach , tried to overtake him by the shorter cut and found themselves , being heavy men , almost up to their knees in shoals of slippery shingle . Two who had been slower with their bodies were quicker with their minds , and seeing Turnbull ' s trick , ran along the edge of the road after him . Then MacIan finally awoke , and leaving half his sleeve in the	s
had told him so he would have taken it as an ordinary compliment . If you had asked him about women , he would have said that one must preserve their domesticity and decorum ; he would have used the stalest words , but he would have in reserve the strongest arguments . If you had asked him about government , he would have said that all citizens were free and equal , but he would have meant what he said . If you had asked him about education , he would have said that the young must be trained up in habits of industry and of respect for their parents . Still he would have set them the example of industry , and he would have been one of the parents whom they could respect . A state of mind so hopelessly central is depressing to the English instinct . But then in England a man announcing these platitudes is generally a fool and a frightened fool , announcing them out of mere social servility . But Durand was anything but a fool ; he had read all the eighteenth century , and could have defended his platitudes round	l
. In her home she had a habit of being invisible , sometimes through insatiable domesticity , sometimes through an equally insatiable solitude . M . Bert did not give the impression of a pious man , though he did give , especially with his eyes , the impression of an honest one . But he went to Mass with a simple exactitude that could not be mistaken for a pose , or even for a vulgar fascination . It was perhaps this religious regularity which eventually drew Madeleine into recognition of him . At least it is certain that she twice spoke to him with her square and open smile in the porch of the church ; and there was human nature enough in the hamlet to turn even that into gossip . But the real interest arose suddenly as a squall arises with the extraordinary affair that occurred about five days after . There was about a third of a mile beyond the village of Haroc a large but lonely hotel upon the London or Paris model , but commonly almost entirely empty . Among the accidental group of guests who had come to it at this season	l
implacable . " I would do anything but that for you ," he said ; " but no man can be called less than a man ." She looked at him for a moment with a face openly puzzled , and then broke into an odd and beautiful half - smile . " Oh , I don ' t mean that ," she said ; " I don ' t talk about what I don ' t understand . No one has ever hit me ; and if they had I should not feel as a man may . I	s
the heart . M . Camille Bert was by no means placid . Before that incomplete gesture and frankly pleading face he retreated as if from the jaws of a dragon . His dark black hair and beard looked utterly unnatural against the startling pallor of his face . When at last he said something it was : " O God ! I can ' t stand this !" He did not say it in French . Nor did he , strictly speaking , say it in English . The truth ( interesting only to anthropologists ) is that he said it in Scotch . " There will be another mass in a matter of eight hours ," said Madeleine , with a sort of business eagerness and energy , " and you can do it then before the fighting . You must forgive me , but I was so frightened that you would not do it at all ." Bert seemed to crush his teeth together until they broke , and managed to say between them : " And why should you suppose that I shouldn ' t do as you say -- I mean not to do it	l
it is only a bit of bread ," said the girl , and her lips tightened ever so little . " I know it is only a bit of bread ," said Turnbull , with violence . She flung back her open face and smiled . " Then why did you refuse to eat it ?" she said . James Turnbull made a little step backward , and for the first time in his life there seemed to break out and blaze in his head thoughts that were not his own . " Why , how silly of them ," cried out Madeleine , with quite a schoolgirl gaiety , " why , how silly of them to call _you_ a blasphemer ! Why , you have wrecked your whole business because you would not commit blasphemy ." The man stood , a somewhat comic figure in his tragic bewilderment , with the honest red head of James Turnbull sticking out of the rich and fictitious garments of Camille Bert . But the startled pain of his face was strong enough to obliterate the oddity . " You come down here ," continued the lady , with that female emphasis	l
which is so pulverizing in conversation and so feeble at a public meeting , " you and your MacIan come down here and put on false beards or noses in order to fight . You pretend to be a Catholic commercial traveller from France . Poor Mr . MacIan has to pretend to be a dissolute nobleman from nowhere . Your scheme succeeds ; you pick a quite convincing quarrel ; you arrange a quite respectable duel ; the duel you have planned so long will come off tomorrow with absolute certainty and safety . And then you throw off	s
one rainy morning after daybreak they saw that distinct shape of a solitary island standing up against the encircling strip of silver which ran round the skyline and separated the grey and green of the billows from the grey and mauve of the morning clouds . " What can it be ?" cried MacIan , in a dry - throated excitement . " I didn ' t know there were any Atlantic islands so far beyond the Scillies -- Good Lord , it can ' t be Madeira , yet ?" " I thought you were fond of legends and	s
triumph . They tumbled on shore and began to unload the vessel , setting the stores out in rows upon the sand with something of the solemnity of boys playing at pirates . There were Mr . Wilkinson ' s cigar - boxes and Mr . Wilkinson ' s dozen of champagne and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned salmon and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned tongue and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned sardines , and every sort of preserved thing that could be seen at the Army and Navy stores . Then MacIan stopped with a jar	s
. " We could drink all the wine and smoke all the cigars easily in a week ," said Turnbull ; " and that would be to die feasting like heroes ." " Yes , and there is something else ," said MacIan , with slight hesitation . " You see , we are on an almost unknown rock , lost in the Atlantic . The police will never catch us ; but then neither may the public ever hear of us ; and that was one of the things we wanted ." Then , after a pause , he said , drawing in the sand with his sword - point : " She may never hear of it at all ." " Well ?" inquired the other , puffing at his cigar . " Well ," said MacIan , " we might occupy a day or two in drawing up a thorough and complete statement of what we did and why we did it , and all about both our points of view . Then we could leave one copy on the island whatever happens to us and put another in an empty bottle and send it out to	l
tragedy . " Perhaps when the morning stars were made ," he said to himself , " God built this island up from the bottom of the world to be a tower and a theatre for the fight between yea and nay ." Then he wandered up to the highest level of the rock , where there was a roof or plateau of level stone . Half an hour afterwards , Turnbull found him clearing away the loose sand from this table - land and making it smooth and even . " We will fight up here , Turnbull ," said MacIan , " when the time comes . And till the time comes this place shall be sacred ." " I thought of having lunch up here ," said Turnbull , who had a bottle of champagne in his hand . " No , no -- not up here ," said MacIan , and came down from the height quite hastily . Before he descended , however , he fixed the two swords upright , one at each end of the platform , as if they were human sentinels to guard it under the stars . Then they came	l
down and lunched plentifully in a nest of loose rocks . In the same place that night they supped more plentifully still . The smoke of Mr . Wilkinson ' s cigars went up ceaseless and strong smelling , like a pagan sacrifice ; the golden glories of Mr . Wilkinson ' s champagne rose to their heads and poured out of them in fancies and philosophies . And occasionally they would look up at the starlight and the rock and see the space guarded by the two cross - hilted swords , which looked like two black crosses at	s
had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon . But Turnbull being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene . The consequence of which was that he nearly fell off the rock . On three sides of this shelly and sandy islet the sea stretched blue and infinite without a speck of land or sail ; the same as Turnbull had first seen it , except that the tide being out it showed a few yards more of slanting sand under the roots of the	s
me all about it . The bottle containing our declaration , doctrines , and dying sentiments was washed up on Margate beach yesterday in the presence of one alderman , two bathing - machine men , three policemen , seven doctors , and a hundred and thirteen London clerks on a holiday , to all of whom , whether directly or indirectly , our composition gave enormous literary pleasure . Buck up , old man , this story of ours is a switchback . I have begun to understand the pulse and the time of it ; now we are	s
up in a cathedral and then we are down in a theatre , where they only play farces . Come , I am quite reconciled -- let us enjoy the farce ." But MacIan said nothing , and an instant afterwards Turnbull himself called out in an entirely changed voice : " Oh , this is damnable ! This is not to be borne !" MacIan followed his eye along the sand - hills . He saw what looked like the momentary and waving figure of the nigger minstrel , and then he saw a heavy running policeman take the turn of the sand - hill with the smooth solemnity of a railway train . XIII . THE GARDEN OF PEACE Up to this instant Evan MacIan had really understood nothing ; but when he saw the policeman he saw everything . He saw his enemies , all the powers and princes of the earth . He suddenly altered from a staring statue to a leaping man of the mountains . " We must break away from him here ," he cried , briefly , and went like a whirlwind over the sand ridge in a straight line and at	l
a particular angle . When the policeman had finished his admirable railway curve , he found a wall of failing sand between him and the pursued . By the time he had scaled it thrice , slid down twice , and crested it in the third effort , the two flying figures were far in front . They found the sand harder farther on ; it began to be crusted with scraps of turf and in a few moments they were flying easily over an open common of rank sea - grass . They had no easy business , however	s
; for the bottle which they had so innocently sent into the chief gate of Thanet had called to life the police of half a county on their trail . From every side across the grey - green common figures could be seen running and closing in ; and it was only when MacIan with his big body broke down the tangled barrier of a little wood , as men break down a door with the shoulder ; it was only when they vanished crashing into the underworld of the black wood , that their hunters were even instantaneously thrown off the scent . At the risk of struggling a little longer like flies in that black web of twigs and trunks , Evan ( who had an instinct of the hunter or the hunted ) took an incalculable course through the forest , which let them out at last by a forest opening -- quite forgotten by the leaders of the chase . They ran a mile or two farther along the edge of the wood until they reached another and somewhat similar opening . Then MacIan stood utterly still and listened , as animals listen , for every	l
pounding and panting -- a fat but powerful policeman who had distanced all the rest . He came on at a splendid pace for so portly a figure ; but , like all heavy bodies in motion , he gave the impression that it would be easier for him to increase his pace than to slacken it suddenly . Nothing short of a brick wall could have abruptly brought him up . Turnbull turned his head slightly and found breath to say something to MacIan . MacIan nodded . Pursuer and pursued were fixed in their distance as they fled	s
the direction by which they had come , doubling on their tracks to throw off the last pursuit . MacIan could not rid himself of the fancy of bestriding a steed ; the long , grey coping of the wall shot out in front of him , like the long , grey neck of some nightmare Rosinante . He had the quaint thought that he and Turnbull were two knights on one steed on the old shield of the Templars . The nightmare of the stone horse was increased by the white fog , which seemed thicker inside the wall than outside . They could make nothing of the enclosure upon which they were partial trespassers , except that the green and crooked branches of a big apple - tree came crawling at them out of the mist , like the tentacles of some green cuttlefish . Anything would serve , however , that was likely to confuse their trail , so they both decided without need of words to use this tree also as a ladder -- a ladder of descent . When they dropped from the lowest branch to the ground their stockinged feet felt hard gravel beneath	l
, black ribbon , drooped from his aquiline nose , and he smiled , as he communed with himself , with a self - content which was rare and almost irritating . The straw panama on his head was many shades shabbier than his clothes , as if he had caught it up by accident . It needed the full shock of the huge shadow of MacIan , falling across his sunlit path , to rouse him from his smiling reverie . When this had fallen on him he lifted his head a little and blinked at the intruders with short - sighted benevolence , but with far less surprise than might have been expected . He was a gentleman ; that is , he had social presence of mind , whether for kindness or for insolence . " Can I do anything for you ?" he said , at last . MacIan bowed . " You can extend to us your pardon ," he said , for he also came of a whole race of gentlemen -- of gentlemen without shirts to their backs . " I am afraid we are trespassing . We have just come over the	l
a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging . This seeming host of theirs might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulty at cards or even escape from a pursuing tailor ; but it still remained doubtful whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquake instant when the Virgin is compared to a goddess of Mesopotamia . Even MacIan , therefore ( whose tact was far from being his strong point ), felt the necessity for some compromise in the mode of approach . At last he said , and even then with hesitation : " We are fighting about God ; there can be nothing so important as that ." The tilted eye - glasses of the old gentleman fell abruptly from his nose , and he thrust his aristocratic chin so far forward that his lean neck seemed to shoot out longer like a telescope . " About God ?" he queried , in a key completely new . " Look here !" cried Turnbull , taking his turn roughly , " I ' ll tell you what it ' s all about . I	l
think that there ' s no God . I take it that it ' s nobody ' s business but mine -- or God ' s , if there is one . This young gentleman from the Highlands happens to think that it ' s his business . In consequence , he first takes a walking - stick and smashes my shop ; then he takes the same walking - stick and tries to smash me . To this I naturally object . I suggest that if it comes to that we should both have sticks . He improves on	s
the other , thoroughly amused . " How funny it is to think that you have tumbled over a garden wall and fallen exactly on the right person ! You might have gone floundering about in all sorts of churches and chapels and colleges and schools of philosophy looking for some evidence of the existence of God . Why , there is no evidence , except seeing him . And now you ' ve seen him . You ' ve seen him dance !" And the obliging old gentleman instantly stood on one leg without relaxing at all the grave and cultured benignity of his expression . " I understood that this garden ----" began the bewildered MacIan . " Quite so ! Quite so !" said the man on one leg , nodding gravely . " I said this garden belonged to me and the land outside it . So they do . So does the country beyond that and the sea beyond that and all the rest of the earth . So does the moon . So do the sun and stars ." And he added , with a smile of apology : " You see , I	l
. " Of course you won ' t trust him much ; come to me for everything . But in my position one has to meet so many people . One has to be broadminded ." The big banker in the black frock - coat and hat was standing quite grave and dignified on the lawn , save for his slight twitch of one limb , and he did not seem by any means unworthy of the part which the other promptly forced upon him . " My dear fellow ," said the man in the straw hat , "	s
in the wind , and each of them telling eagerly some evil that had not happened or some terrific secret which was not true . All the rationalist and plain man revolted within him against bowing down for a moment in that forest of deception and egotistical darkness . He wanted to blow up that palace of delusions with dynamite ; and in some wild way , which I will not defend , he tried to do it . He looked across at MacIan and said : " Oh , I can ' t stand this !" " Can '	s
hard to follow ," remarked Turnbull , genially , " and sometimes so much so as to be hardly worth following ." " I alone am loyal ," insisted MacIan ; " for I alone am in rebellion . I am ready at any instant to restore the Stuarts . I am ready at any instant to defy the Hanoverian brood -- and I defy it now even when face to face with the actual ruler of the enormous British Empire !" And folding his arms and throwing back his lean , hawklike face , he haughtily confronted the man	s
whom your damned tracts and hymns and priests have driven out of his wits . Five men in this place , they tell me , five men in this place who might have been fathers of families , and every one of them thinks he is God the Father . Oh ! you may talk about the ugliness of science , but there is no one here who thinks he is Protoplasm ." " They naturally prefer a bright part ," said MacIan , wearily . " Protoplasm is not worth going mad about ." " At least ," said	s
hare and hounds and hide and seek -- I dare say you ' ve heard of it . We are the hares , and , seeing your high wall look so inviting , we tumbled over it , and naturally were a little startled with what we found on the other side ." " Quite so !" said the doctor , mildly . " I can understand that you were startled ." Turnbull had expected him to ask what place was the headquarters of the new exhilarating game , and who were the male and female enthusiasts who had brought it to such perfection ; in fact , Turnbull was busy making up these personal and topographical particulars . As the doctor did not ask the question , he grew slightly uneasy , and risked the question : " I hope you will accept my assurance that the thing was an accident and that no intrusion was meant ." " Oh , yes , sir ," replied the doctor , smiling , " I accept everything that you say ." " In that case ," said Turnbull , rising genially , " we must not further interrupt your important duties	l
" It is a question of time , of receptivity , and treatment ," said the doctor , arching his eyebrows indifferently . " I do not regard either of your cases as incurable ." And with that the man of the world was struck dumb , and , as in all intolerable moments , the word was with the unworldly . MacIan took one stride to the table , leant across it , and said : " We can ' t stop here , we ' re not mad people !" " We don ' t use the crude phrase ," said the doctor , smiling at his patent - leather boots . " But you _can ' t_ think us mad ," thundered MacIan . " You never saw us before . You know nothing about us . You haven ' t even examined us ." The doctor threw back his head and beard . " Oh , yes ," he said , " very thoroughly ." " But you can ' t shut a man up on your mere impressions without documents or certificates or anything ?" The doctor got languidly to his feet . " Quite	l
rank of such images , and Evan thought there was another round the steps below . When they came closer he saw that they were figures in complete armour of steel or silver , each with a naked sword , point upward ; and then he saw one of the swords move . These were not statues but an armed order of chivalry thrown in three circles round the cross . MacIan drew in his breath , as children do at anything they think utterly beautiful . For he could imagine nothing that so echoed his own visions of pontifical or chivalric art as this white dome sitting like a vast silver tiara over London , ringed with a triple crown of swords . As they went sailing down Ludgate Hill , Evan saw that the state of the streets fully answered his companion ' s claim about the reintroduction of order . All the old blackcoated bustle with its cockney vivacity and vulgarity had disappeared . Groups of labourers , quietly but picturesquely clad , were passing up and down in sufficiently large numbers ; but it required but a few mounted men to keep the streets in order	l
with you and your cathedrals . Something is wrong ; everything is wrong . You are not an angel . That is not a church . It is not the rightful king who has come home ." " That is unfortunate ," said the other , in a quiet but hard voice , " because you are going to see his Majesty ." " No ," said MacIan , " I am going to jump over the side ." " Do you desire death ?" " No ," said Evan , quite composedly , " I desire a miracle ."	s
across the garden , a drift of red leaves , like the leaves of autumn , as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud . There was a sense in earth and heaven as of everything breaking up , and all the revolutionist in Turnbull rejoiced that it was breaking up . The trees were breaking up under the wind , even in the tall strength of their bloom : the clouds were breaking up and losing even their large heraldic shapes . Shards and shreds of copper cloud split off continually and floated by themselves ,	s
sceptic ; he had the air of thinking thoroughly , and then he said : " No , I don ' t think it ' s my friend MacIan that taught me that . I think I should always have said that I don ' t like this . These people have rights ." " Rights !" repeated the unknown in a tone quite indescribable . Then he added with a more open sneer : " Perhaps they also have souls ." " They have lives !" said Turnbull , sternly ; " that is quite enough for me .	s
leaders ." " Thank you ," replied Turnbull with the same painful constraint . " I have heard about your revolutionary war , and I think on the whole that I would rather be anywhere else ." " Do you want to be taken to a monastery ," snarled the other , " with MacIan and his winking Madonnas ." " I want to be taken to a madhouse ," said Turnbull distinctly , giving the direction with a sort of precision . " I want to go back to exactly the same lunatic asylum from which I came ." " Why ?" asked the unknown . " Because I want a little sane and wholesome society ," answered Turnbull . There was a long and peculiar silence , and then the man driving the flying machine said quite coolly : " I won ' t take you back ." And then Turnbull said equally coolly : " Then I ' ll jump out of the car ." The unknown rose to his full height , and the expression in his eyes seemed to be made of ironies behind ironies , as two mirrors infinitely reflect each other . At	l
lamp on it , the light of which was just sufficient to show a slender , well - bred figure in an ordinary medical black frock - coat , whose head , quite silvered with age , was bent over neat piles of notes . This gentleman looked up for an instant as they entered , and the lamplight fell on his glittering spectacles and long , clean - shaven face -- a face which would have been simply like an aristocrat ' s but that a certain lion poise of the head and long cleft in the chin made it look more like a very handsome actor ' s . It was only for a flash that his face was thus lifted . Then he bent his silver head over his notes once more , and said , without looking up again : " I told you , Dr . Quayle , that these men were to go to cells B and C ." Turnbull and MacIan looked at each other , and said more than they could ever say with tongues or swords . Among other things they said that to that particular Head of the institution it	l
Even the shape of his cell especially irritated him . It was a long , narrow parallelogram , which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other ; but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space , like the prow of a ship . After three days of silence and cocoa , this angle at the end began to infuriate Turnbull . It maddened him to think that two lines came together and pointed at nothing . After the fifth day he was reckless , and	s
a pipe here or there may leak . Turnbull thrust his first finger down the aperture , and at last managed to make a slight further fissure in the piping . The light that came up from beyond was very faint , and apparently indirect ; it seemed to fall from some hole or window higher up . As he was screwing his eye to peer at this grey and greasy twilight he was astonished to see another human finger very long and lean come down from above towards the broken pipe and hook it up to something higher .	s
, with a point . Like this ," and he made lovingly with his hands a map of the room in the air . " But that ' s not the best ," he added , confidentially . " Squares very good ; I have a nice long holiday , and can count them . But that ' s not the best ." " What is the best ?" asked Turnbull in great distress . " Spike is the best ," said the old man , opening his blue eyes blazing ; " it sticks out ." The words Turnbull spoke broke out of him in pure pity . " Can ' t we do anything for you ?" he said . " I am very happy ," said the other , alphabetically . " You are a good man . Can I help you ?" " No , I don ' t think you can , sir ," said Turnbull with rough pathos ; " I am glad you are contented at least ." The weird old person opened his broad blue eyes and fixed Turnbull with a stare extraordinarily severe . " You are quite sure ," he	l
be downhearted ; the real days of tyranny are only beginning on this earth ." And with that the Master laughed and swung away from them , almost as if his laugh was a bad thing for people to see . " Might I speak to you a moment ?" said Turnbull , stepping forward with a respectful resolution . But the shoulders of the Master only seemed to take on a new and unexpected angle of mockery as he strode away . Turnbull swung round with great abruptness to the other two doctors , and said , harshly : " What in snakes does he mean -- and who are you ?" " My name is Hutton ," said the short , stout man , " and I am -- well , one of those whose business it is to uphold this establishment ." " My name is Turnbull ," said the other ; " I am one of those whose business it is to tear it to the ground ." The small doctor smiled , and Turnbull ' s anger seemed suddenly to steady him . " But I don ' t want to talk about that ,"	l
he said , calmly ; " I only want to know what the Master of this asylum really means ." Dr . Hutton ' s smile broke into a laugh which , short as it was , had the suspicion of a shake in it . " I suppose you think that quite a simple question ," he said . " I think it a plain question ," said Turnbull , " and one that deserves a plain answer . Why did the Master lock us up in a couple of cupboards like jars of pickles for a mortal month	s
I ' m not the Prime Minister ; we ' re not the House of Lords ." " He wasn ' t afraid of the Prime Minister ," replied Dr . Hutton ; " he isn ' t afraid of the House of Lords . But ----" " Well ?" inquired Turnbull , stamping again . " He is afraid of you ," said Hutton , simply . " Why , didn ' t you know ?" MacIan , who had not spoken yet , made one stride forward and stood with shaking limbs and shining eyes . " He was afraid !" began Evan , thickly . " You mean to say that we ----" " I mean to say the plain truth now that the danger is over ," said Hutton , calmly ; " most certainly you two were the only people he ever was afraid of ." Then he added in a low but not inaudible voice : " Except one -- whom he feared worse , and has buried deeper ." " Come away ," cried MacIan , " this has to be thought about ." Turnbull followed him in silence as he strode away	l
pack of rat - catching chemists all say that I ' ve lost my wits ." " You !" cried Turnbull with terrible emphasis . " You ! Lost your wits !" In the rush of his real astonishment at this towering unreality Turnbull almost added : " Why , you haven ' t got any to lose ." But he fortunately remembered the remains of his desperate diplomacy . " This can ' t go on ," he said , positively . " Men like MacIan and I may suffer unjustly all our lives , but a man like	s
saw the man of flesh approach that beautiful phantom , saw their gestures of recognition , and saw them against the sunset joining hands . He could stand it no longer , but ran across to the path , turned the corner and saw standing quite palpable in the evening sunlight , talking with a casual grace to Turnbull , the face and figure which had filled his midnights with frightfully vivid or desperately half - forgotten features . She advanced quite pleasantly and coolly , and put out her hand . The moment that he touched it he knew that he was sane even if the solar system was crazy . She was entirely elegant and unembarrassed . That is the awful thing about women -- they refuse to be emotional at emotional moments , upon some such ludicrous pretext as there being someone else there . But MacIan was in a condition of criticism much less than the average masculine one , being in fact merely overturned by the rushing riddle of the events . Evan does not know to this day what particular question he asked , but he vividly remembers that she answered , and every	l
phenomena of a good garden were really a pleasure to him ; but after three - quarters of an hour or so even the apostle of science began to find rhododendrus a bore , and was somewhat relieved when an unexpected development of events obliged him to transfer his researches to the equally interesting subject of hollyhocks , which grew some fifty feet farther along the path . The ostensible cause of his removal was the unexpected reappearance of his two other acquaintances walking and talking laboriously along the way , with the black head bent close to the brown	s
" After that we belong to each other . We are sort of sold to each other -- until the stars fall ." Then he looked up suddenly , and said : " By the way , what is your name ?" " My name is Beatrice Drake ," she replied with complete gravity . " You can see it on my certificate of lunacy ." XIX . THE LAST PARLEY Turnbull walked away , wildly trying to explain to himself the presence of two personal acquaintances so different as Vane and the girl . As he skirted a low	s
. Then he said with hurried amiability : " Why , of course you did . Quite so , quite so ," and with courteous gestures went striding up the garden path . Under the first laburnum - tree he stopped , however , and pulling out his pencil and notebook wrote down feverishly : " Singular development in the Elenthero - maniac , Turnbull . Sudden manifestation of Rapinavititis -- the delusion that one has stolen a ship . First case ever recorded ." Turnbull stood for an instant staggered into stillness . Then he ran raging round the	s
garden to find MacIan , just as a husband , even a bad husband , will run raging to find his wife if he is full of a furious query . He found MacIan stalking moodily about the half - lit garden , after his extraordinary meeting with Beatrice . No one who saw his slouching stride and sunken head could have known that his soul was in the seventh heaven of ecstasy . He did not think ; he did not even very definitely desire . He merely wallowed in memories , chiefly in material memories ; words said with a certain cadence or trivial turns of the neck or wrist . Into the middle of his stationary and senseless enjoyment were thrust abruptly the projecting elbow and the projecting red beard of Turnbull . MacIan stepped back a little , and the soul in his eyes came very slowly to its windows . When James Turnbull had the glittering sword - point planted upon his breast he was in far less danger . For three pulsating seconds after the interruption MacIan was in a mood to have murdered his father . And yet his whole emotional anger fell	l
" Yes ," said MacIan , after a slight pause , " I mean the poor old idiot who likes spikes to stick out . When I saw his eyes and heard his old croaking accent , I knew that it would not really have been right to kill you . It would have been a venial sin ." " I am much obliged ," said Turnbull , gruffly . " You must give me time ," said MacIan , quite patiently , " for I am trying to tell the whole truth . I am trying to tell more	s
of it than I know ." " So you see I confess "-- he went on with laborious distinctness -- " I confess that all the people who called our duel mad were right in a way . I would confess it to old Cumberland Vane and his eye - glass . I would confess it even to that old ass in brown flannel who talked to us about Love . Yes , they are right in a way . I am a little mad ." He stopped and wiped his brow as if he were literally doing heavy labour . Then he went on : " I am a little mad ; but , after all , it is only a little madness . When hundreds of high - minded men had fought duesl about a jostle with the elbow or the ace of spades , the whole world need not have gone wild over my one little wildness . Plenty of other people have killed themselves between then and now . But all England has gone into captivity in order to take us captive . All England has turned into a lunatic asylum in order to prove us	l
lunatics . Compared with the general public , I might positively be called sane ." He stopped again , and went on with the same air of travailing with the truth : " When I saw that , I saw everything ; I saw the Church and the world . The Church in its earthly action has really touched morbid things -- tortures and bleeding visions and blasts of extermination . The Church has had her madnesses , and I am one of them . I am the massacre of St . Bartholomew . I am the Inquisition of Spain	s
, exalted for a moment in the enormous simplicity of his success , and then walked across the hall and vanished through an inner door . His two lieutenants , Quayle and Hutton , were left standing at the head of the great army of servants and keepers . " I hope we shall have no more trouble ," said Dr . Quayle pleasantly enough , and addressing Turnbull , who was leaning heavily upon the back of a chair . Still looking down , Turnbull lifted the chair an inch or two from the ground . Then he suddenly swung it above his head and sent it at the inquiring doctor with an awful crash which sent one of its wooden legs loose along the floor and crammed the doctor gasping into a corner . MacIan gave a great shout , snatched up the loose chair - leg , and , rushing on the other doctor , felled him with a blow . Twenty attendants rushed to capture the rebels ; MacIan flung back three of them and Turnbull went over on top of one , when from behind them all came a shriek as of something quite fresh	l
." " So this is suicide ," sneered the doctor ; " a somewhat doubtful sign of sanity ." " Not at all -- this is vengeance ," answered Turnbull , quite calmly ; " a thing which is completely healthy ." " You think the doctors will go ," said Hutton , savagely . " The keepers have gone already ," said Turnbull . Even as they spoke the main doors were burst open in mere brutal panic , and all the officers and subordinates of the asylum rushed away across the garden pursued by the smoke . But	s
among the ticketed maniacs not a man or woman moved . " We hate dying ," said Turnbull , with composure , " but we hate you even more . This is a successful revolution ." In the roof above their heads a panel shot back , showing a strip of star - lit sky and a huge thing made of white metal , with the shape and fins of a fish , swinging as if at anchor . At the same moment a steel ladder slid down from the opening and struck the floor , and the cleft chin of the mysterious Master was thrust into the opening . " Quayle , Hutton ," he said , " you will escape with me ." And they went up the ladder like automata of lead . Long after they had clambered into the car , the creature with the cloven face continued to leer down upon the smoke - stung crowd below . Then at last he said in a silken voice and with a smile of final satisfaction : " By the way , I fear I am very absent minded . There is one man specially whom ,	l
, and through the diminished din of it the voice of the little old lunatic came clearer . In the heart of that white - hot hell he was singing like a bird . What he was singing it was not very easy to follow , but it seemed to be something about playing in the golden hay . " Good Lord !" cried Turnbull , bitterly , " there seem to be some advantages in really being an idiot ." Then advancing to the fringe of the fire he called out on chance to the invisible singer : " Can you come out ? Are you cut off ?" " God help us all !" said MacIan , with a shudder ; " he ' s laughing now ." At whatever stage of being burned alive the invisible now found himself , he was now shaking out peals of silvery and hilarious laughter . As he listened , MacIan ' s two eyes began to glow , as if a strange thought had come into his head . " Fool , come out and save yourself !" shouted Turnbull . " No , by Heaven ! that is not	l
the stars , like golden dragons chained but struggling . The towers and domes of the oppressive smoke seemed high and far enough to drown distant planets in a London fog . But if we exhausted all frantic similes for that frantic scene , the main impression about the fire would still be its ranked upstanding rigidity and a sort of roaring stillness . It was literally a wall of fire . " Father ," cried MacIan , once more , " come out of it and save us all !" Turnbull was staring at him as he cried . The tall and steady forest of fire must have been already a portent visible to the whole circle of land and sea . The red flush of it lit up the long sides of white ships far out in the German Ocean , and picked out like piercing rubies the windows in the villages on the distant heights . If any villagers or sailors were looking towards it they must have seen a strange sight as MacIan cried out for the third time . That forest of fire wavered , and was cloven in the centre ; and then the	l
nearer , Evan fell on his knees , and after an instant Beatrice followed ; then Madeleine fell on her knees , and after a longer instant Turnbull followed . Then the little old man went past them singing down that corridor of flames . They had not looked at his face . When he had passed they looked up . While the first light of the fire had shot east and west , painting the sides of ships with fire - light or striking red sparks out of windowed houses , it had not hitherto struck upward , for there was above it the ponderous and rococo cavern of its own monstrous coloured smoke . But now the fire was turned to left and right like a woman ' s hair parted in the middle , and now the shafts of its light could shoot up into empty heavens and strike anything , either bird or cloud . But it struck something that was neither cloud nor bird . Far , far away up in those huge hollows of space something was flying swiftly and shining brightly , something that shone too bright and flew too fast to be	l
second flying , spread out and sprawling in the fire - light , were the dead bodies of the two doctors whom Professor Lucifer had carried with him -- the weak and sneering Quayle , the cold and clumsy Hutton . They went with a crash into the thick of the fire . " They are gone !" screamed Beatrice , hiding her head . " O God ! The are lost !" Evan put his arm about her , and remembered his own vision . " No , they are not lost ," he said . " They are saved . He has taken away no souls with him , after all ." He looked vaguely about at the fire that was already fading , and there among the ashes lay two shining things that had survived the fire , his sword and Turnbull ' s , fallen haphazard in the pattern of a cross .

were always nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window . A tantalus containing three kinds of spirit , all of a liqueur excellence , stood always on this table of luxury ; but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky , brandy , and rum seemed always to stand at the same level . Poetry was there : the left - hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of English classics as the right hand could show of English and foreign physiologists . But if one took a volume of Chaucer or Shelley from that rank , its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man ' s front teeth . One could not say the books were never read ; probably they were , but there was a sense of their being chained to their places , like the Bibles in the old churches . Dr Hood treated his private book - shelf as if it were a public library . And if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco , it goes without saying that	l
is Brown . Pray excuse me . I ' ve come about that business of the MacNabs . I have heard , you often help people out of such troubles . Pray excuse me if I am wrong ." By this time he had sprawlingly recovered the hat , and made an odd little bobbing bow over it , as if setting everything quite right . " I hardly understand you ," replied the scientist , with a cold intensity of manner . " I fear you have mistaken the chambers . I am Dr Hood , and my work is almost entirely literary and educational . It is true that I have sometimes been consulted by the police in cases of peculiar difficulty and importance , but --" " Oh , this is of the greatest importance ," broke in the little man called Brown . " Why , her mother won ' t let them get engaged ." And he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality . The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly , but the eyes under them were bright with something that might be anger or might be amusement . "	l
fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door . He declares his privacy is temporary and justified , and promises to explain before the wedding . That is all that anyone knows for certain , but Mrs MacNab will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of . You know how the tales grow like grass on such a patch of ignorance as that . There are tales of two voices heard talking in the room ; though , when the door is opened , Todhunter is always found alone . There are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat , who once came out of the sea - mists and apparently out of the sea , stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small back garden at twilight , till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open window . The colloquy seemed to end in a quarrel . Todhunter dashed down his window with violence , and the man in the high hat melted into the sea - fog again . This story is told by the	l
massacre of flies in winter or the return of birds in spring . Now the root fact in all history is Race . Race produces religion ; Race produces legal and ethical wars . There is no stronger case than that of the wild , unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the Celts , of whom your friends the MacNabs are specimens . Small , swarthy , and of this dreamy and drifting blood , they accept easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents , just as they still accept ( you will excuse me for saying )	s
" Are you going to take those ropes off ?" asked the girl stubbornly . Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table , and went across to the captive . He studied him intently , even moving him a little and half - turning him round by the shoulders , but he only answered : " No ; I think these ropes will do very well till your friends the police bring the handcuffs ." Father Brown , who had been looking dully at the carpet , lifted his round face and said : " What do you mean ?" The man of science had picked up the peculiar dagger - sword from the carpet and was examining it intently as he answered : " Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up ," he said , " you all jump to the conclusion that Mr Glass had tied him up ; and then , I suppose , escaped . There are four objections to this : First , why should a gentleman so dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him , if he left of his own free will ? Second ," he	l
continued , moving towards the window , " this is the only exit , and it is locked on the inside . Third , this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point , but there is no wound on Mr Todhunter . Mr Glass took that wound away with him , dead or alive . Add to all this primary probability . It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus , rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg . There	s
the company . " Yes , that ' s it !" he cried in a certain excitement . " Can ' t you see it in the man ' s face ? Why , look at his eyes !" Both the Professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance . And though the broad black scarf completely masked the lower half of Todhunter ' s visage , they did grow conscious of something struggling and intense about the upper part of it . " His eyes do look queer ," cried the young woman , strongly moved .	s
of assent . " It does seem a pity ," he said . Orion Hood broke into a contemptuous laugh . " Well ," he said , " before we go on to the hundred and one other evidences , let us take the first proof we found ; the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room . If there is no Mr Glass , whose hat is this ?" " It is Mr Todhunter ' s ," replied Father Brown . " But it doesn ' t fit him ," cried Hood impatiently . "	s
He couldn ' t possibly wear it !" Father Brown shook his head with ineffable mildness . " I never said he could wear it ," he answered . " I said it was his hat . Or , if you insist on a shade of difference , a hat that is his ." " And what is the shade of difference ?" asked the criminologist with a slight sneer . " My good sir ," cried the mild little man , with his first movement akin to impatience , " if you will walk down the street to the nearest hatter ' s shop , you will see that there is , in common speech , a difference between a man ' s hat and the hats that are his ." " But a hatter ," protested Hood , " can get money out of his stock of new hats . What could Todhunter get out of this one old hat ?" " Rabbits ," replied Father Brown promptly . " What ?" cried Dr Hood . " Rabbits , ribbons , sweetmeats , goldfish , rolls of coloured paper ," said the reverend gentleman with rapidity . "	l
he ' s got eyes like blue buttons ; he ' s not energetic , he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic . He ' s a conscientious , kindly old blockhead ; but he ' s got money simply because he collects money , as a boy collects stamps . You ' re too strong - minded for business , Ezza . You won ' t get on . To be clever enough to get all that money , one must be stupid enough to want it ." " I ' m stupid enough for that ," said Ezza gloomily . " But I should suggest a suspension of your critique of the banker , for here he comes ." Mr Harrogate , the great financier , did indeed enter the room , but nobody looked at him . He was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eye and faded grey - sandy moustaches ; but for his heavy stoop he might have been a colonel . He carried several unopened letters in his hand . His son Frank was a really fine lad , curly - haired , sun - burnt and strenuous ;	l
person at a flying leap next to the lovely Englishwoman ; on the other side of her sat the priest , whose name was Brown and who was fortunately a silent individual ; the courier and the father and son were on the banc behind . Muscari was in towering spirits , seriously believing in the peril , and his talk to Ethel might well have made her think him a maniac . But there was something in the crazy and gorgeous ascent , amid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards , that dragged her spirit up alone	s
with his into purple preposterous heavens with wheeling suns . The white road climbed like a white cat ; it spanned sunless chasms like a tight - rope ; it was flung round far - off headlands like a lasso . And yet , however high they went , the desert still blossomed like the rose . The fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming - bird , the hues of a hundred flowering flowers . There are no lovelier meadows and woodlands than the English , no nobler crests or chasms than those of Snowdon and Glencoe . But Ethel Harrogate had never before seen the southern parks tilted on the splintered northern peaks ; the gorge of Glencoe laden with the fruits of Kent . There was nothing here of that chill and desolation that in Britain one associates with high and wild scenery . It was rather like a mosaic palace , rent with earthquakes ; or like a Dutch tulip garden blown to the stars with dynamite . " It ' s like Kew Gardens on Beachy Head ," said Ethel . " It is our secret	l
," answered he , " the secret of the volcano ; that is also the secret of the revolution -- that a thing can be violent and yet fruitful ." " You are rather violent yourself ," and she smiled at him . " And yet rather fruitless ," he admitted ; " if I die tonight I die unmarried and a fool ." " It is not my fault if you have come ," she said after a difficult silence . " It is never your fault ," answered Muscari ; " it was not your fault that Troy	s
valley , and every cross - road in the hills . I will not weary you with the verbalism , since you will be able to check it ; the substance of my proclamation is this : I announce first that I have captured the English millionaire , the colossus of finance , Mr Samuel Harrogate . I next announce that I have found on his person notes and bonds for two thousand pounds , which he has given up to me . Now since it would be really immoral to announce such a thing to a credulous public if	s
pay triple this sum for another day ' s association with such a domestic circle ? I will not conceal from you that the document ends with certain legal phrases about the unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid ; but meanwhile , ladies and gentlemen , let me assure you that I am comfortably off here for accommodation , wine and cigars , and bid you for the present a sportsman - like welcome to the luxuries of the Paradise of Thieves ." All the time that he had been speaking , the dubious -	s
. Yet the spoliation on the spot was emphasized and even put first in the demand . Why should Ezza Montano want so specially to tell all Europe that he had picked the pocket before he levied the blackmail ?" " I cannot imagine ," said Muscari , rubbing up his black hair for once with an unaffected gesture . " You may think you enlighten me , but you are leading me deeper in the dark . What may be the third objection to the King of the Thieves ?" " The third objection ," said Father Brown , still in meditation , " is this bank we are sitting on . Why does our brigand - courier call this his chief fortress and the Paradise of Thieves ? It is certainly a soft spot to fall on and a sweet spot to look at . It is also quite true , as he says , that it is invisible from valley and peak , and is therefore a hiding - place . But it is not a fortress . It never could be a fortress . I think it would be the worst fortress in the world .	l
moment he turned his olive , sneering face and made a movement with his hand . The brigands scattered at the signal , not in confusion , but in what was evidently a kind of guerrilla discipline . Instead of occupying the road along the ridge , they sprinkled themselves along the side of it behind the trees and the hedge , as if watching unseen for an enemy . The noise beyond grew stronger , beginning to shake the mountain road , and a voice could be clearly heard calling out orders . The brigands swayed and huddled ,	s
private character , I have forgotten it . I am no more a genuine brigand than I am a genuine courier . I am only a bundle of masks , and you can ' t fight a duel with that ." And he laughed with boyish pleasure and fell into his old straddling attitude , with his back to the skirmish up the road . Darkness was deepening under the mountain walls , and it was not easy to discern much of the progress of the struggle , save that tall men were pushing their horses ' muzzles through a	s
party throughout Europe , however , Paul Hirsch was a saint of science . His large and daring cosmic theories advertised his austere life and innocent , if somewhat frigid , morality ; he held something of the position of Darwin doubled with the position of Tolstoy . But he was neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot ; his views on disarmament were moderate and evolutionary -- the Republican Government put considerable confidence in him as to various chemical improvements . He had lately even discovered a noiseless explosive , the secret of which the Government was carefully guarding .	s
reasons for not meeting the man himself , but --" Before either could complete a sentence , it was evident that the invader had been expelled from the house opposite . The shrubs under the archway swayed and burst apart , as that unwelcome guest was shot out of them like a cannon - ball . He was a sturdy figure in a small and tilted Tyrolean felt hat , a figure that had indeed something generally Tyrolean about it . The man ' s shoulders were big and broad , but his legs were neat and active in knee	s
- breeches and knitted stockings . His face was brown like a nut ; he had very bright and restless brown eyes ; his dark hair was brushed back stiffly in front and cropped close behind , outlining a square and powerful skull ; and he had a huge black moustache like the horns of a bison . Such a substantial head is generally based on a bull neck ; but this was hidden by a big coloured scarf , swathed round up the man ' s ears and falling in front inside his jacket like a sort of fancy waistcoat . It was a scarf of strong dead colours , dark red and old gold and purple , probably of Oriental fabrication . Altogether the man had something a shade barbaric about him ; more like a Hungarian squire than an ordinary French officer . His French , however , was obviously that of a native ; and his French patriotism was so impulsive as to be slightly absurd . His first act when he burst out of the archway was to call in a clarion voice down the street : " Are there any Frenchmen here ?" as	l
the grey envelope was in the left cupboard ?" he asked . " Positive ," replied Flambeau . " The grey envelope -- it was a white envelope really -- was --" Father Brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and stared across at his companion . " What ?" he asked , in an altered voice . " Well , what ?" repeated Flambeau , eating heartily . " It was not grey ," said the priest . " Flambeau , you frighten me ." " What the deuce are you frightened of ?" " I	s
' m frightened of a white envelope ," said the other seriously , " If it had only just been grey ! Hang it all , it might as well have been grey . But if it was white , the whole business is black . The Doctor has been dabbling in some of the old brimstone after all ." " But I tell you he couldn ' t have written such a note !" cried Flambeau . " The note is utterly wrong about the facts . And innocent or guilty , Dr Hirsch knew all about the facts ." " The man who wrote that note knew all about the facts ," said his clerical companion soberly . " He could never have got ' em so wrong without knowing about ' em . You have to know an awful lot to be wrong on every subject -- like the devil ." " Do you mean --?" " I mean a man telling lies on chance would have told some of the truth ," said his friend firmly . " Suppose someone sent you to find a house with a green door and a blue blind , with	l
easier than the other sorts . I go by a man ' s eyes and voice , don ' t you know , and whether his family seems happy , and by what subjects he chooses -- and avoids . Well , I was puzzled in the Dreyfus case . Not by the horrible things imputed both ways ; I know ( though it ' s not modern to say so ) that human nature in the highest places is still capable of being Cenci or Borgia . No --, what puzzled me was the sincerity of both parties .	s
I don ' t mean the political parties ; the rank and file are always roughly honest , and often duped . I mean the persons of the play . I mean the conspirators , if they were conspirators . I mean the traitor , if he was a traitor . I mean the men who must have known the truth . Now Dreyfus went on like a man who knew he was a wronged man . And yet the French statesmen and soldiers went on as if they knew he wasn ' t a wronged man but simply a wrong ' un . I don ' t mean they behaved well ; I mean they behaved as if they were sure . I can ' t describe these things ; I know what I mean ." " I wish I did ," said his friend . " And what has it to do with old Hirsch ?" " Suppose a person in a position of trust ," went on the priest , " began to give the enemy information because it was false information . Suppose he even thought he was saving his country by misleading the foreigner .	l
. For one of the shortest , in fact . But we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor - cab ." Nothing more could be got out of him until the cab swept round the corner by the Hotel Saint Louis , where they got out , and he led the party up a side lane already in deep shadow with the growing dusk . Once , when the Duke impatiently asked whether Hirsch was guilty of treason or not , he answered rather absently : " No ; only of	s
than we thought ," he said ; " but I suppose he is escaping from France ." " He is escaping from everywhere ," answered Father Brown . Valognes ' s eyes brightened , but his voice sank . " Do you mean suicide ?" he asked . " You will not find his body ," replied the other . A kind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above . " My God ," he exclaimed in French , " I know what this place is now ! Why , it ' s the back of the street	s
such an affair the principals must not meet . Have you read a queer psychological story by Henry James , of two persons who so perpetually missed meeting each other by accident that they began to feel quite frightened of each other , and to think it was fate ? This is something of the kind , but more curious ." " There are people in Paris who will cure them of such morbid fancies ," said Valognes vindictively . " They will jolly well have to meet if we capture them and force them to fight ." " They will not meet on the Day of Judgement ," said the priest . " If God Almighty held the truncheon of the lists , if St Michael blew the trumpet for the swords to cross -- even then , if one of them stood ready , the other would not come ." " Oh , what does all this mysticism mean ?" cried the Duc de Valognes , impatiently ; " why on earth shouldn ' t they meet like other people ?" " They are the opposite of each other ," said Father Brown , with a queer kind	l
and correct , Monsieur , and there ' s something wrong . Things made so opposite are things that cannot quarrel . Wherever the one sticks out the other sinks in . Like a face and a mask , like a lock and a key ..." Flambeau was peering into the house with a visage as white as a sheet . The occupant of the room was standing with his back to him , but in front of a looking - glass , and had already fitted round his face a sort of framework of rank red hair , hanging disordered from the head and clinging round the jaws and chin while leaving the mocking mouth uncovered . Seen thus in the glass the white face looked like the face of Judas laughing horribly and surrounded by capering flames of hell . For a spasm Flambeau saw the fierce , red - brown eyes dancing , then they were covered with a pair of blue spectacles . Slipping on a loose black coat , the figure vanished towards the front of the house . A few moments later a roar of popular applause from the street beyond announced that Dr	l
man from the other end of the tunnel , so they both arrived before the secret stage door almost at the same instant . They saluted each other with civility , and waited a moment before one of them , the sharper walker who seemed to have the shorter patience , knocked at the door . In this and everything else each man was opposite and neither could be called inferior . As private persons both were handsome , capable and popular . As public persons , both were in the first public rank . But everything about them ,	s
from their glory to their good looks , was of a diverse and incomparable kind . Sir Wilson Seymour was the kind of man whose importance is known to everybody who knows . The more you mixed with the innermost ring in every polity or profession , the more often you met Sir Wilson Seymour . He was the one intelligent man on twenty unintelligent committees -- on every sort of subject , from the reform of the Royal Academy to the project of bimetallism for Greater Britain . In the Arts especially he was omnipotent . He was so unique that nobody could quite decide whether he was a great aristocrat who had taken up Art , or a great artist whom the aristocrats had taken up . But you could not meet him for five minutes without realizing that you had really been ruled by him all your life . His appearance was " distinguished " in exactly the same sense ; it was at once conventional and unique . Fashion could have found no fault with his high silk hat --, yet it was unlike anyone else ' s hat -- a little higher , perhaps ,	l
crossed the brow of both visitors ; for the other room was the private room of the great actor with whom Miss Aurora was performing , and she was of the kind that does not inflame admiration without inflaming jealousy . In about half a minute , however , the inner door opened , and she entered as she always did , even in private life , so that the very silence seemed to be a roar of applause , and one well - deserved . She was clad in a somewhat strange garb of peacock green and peacock blue	s
satins , that gleamed like blue and green metals , such as delight children and aesthetes , and her heavy , hot brown hair framed one of those magic faces which are dangerous to all men , but especially to boys and to men growing grey . In company with her male colleague , the great American actor , Isidore Bruno , she was producing a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation of Midsummer Night ' s Dream : in which the artistic prominence was given to Oberon and Titania , or in other words to Bruno and herself . Set in dreamy and exquisite scenery , and moving in mystical dances , the green costume , like burnished beetle - wings , expressed all the elusive individuality of an elfin queen . But when personally confronted in what was still broad daylight , a man looked only at the woman ' s face . She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which kept so many males at the same just dangerous distance from her . She accepted some flowers from Cutler , which were as tropical and expensive as his victories ; and another sort of present	l
Cutler and said in her sweetest manner : " I shall value all these flowers , because they must be your favourite flowers . But they won ' t be complete , you know , without my favourite flower . Do go over to that shop round the corner and get me some lilies - of - the - valley , and then it will be quite lovely ." The first object of her diplomacy , the exit of the enraged Bruno , was at once achieved . He had already handed his spear in a lordly style , like	s
to Father Brown about the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster Cathedral , and then , quite naturally , strolled out himself into the upper end of the passage . Father Brown and Parkinson were left alone , and they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous conversation . The dresser went round the room , pulling out looking - glasses and pushing them in again , his dingy dark coat and trousers looking all the more dismal since he was still holding the festive fairy spear of King Oberon . Every time he pulled out the frame of a new glass , a new black figure of Father Brown appeared ; the absurd glass chamber was full of Father Browns , upside down in the air like angels , turning somersaults like acrobats , turning their backs to everybody like very rude persons . Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses , but followed Parkinson with an idly attentive eye till he took himself and his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno . Then he abandoned himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him -- calculating the angles of	l
men looked down , and in one of them at least the life died in that late light of afternoon . It ran along the passage like a path of gold , and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay lustrous in her robes of green and gold , with her dead face turned upwards . Her dress was torn away as in a struggle , leaving the right shoulder bare , but the wound from which the blood was welling was on the other side . The brass dagger lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away	s
. There was a blank stillness for a measurable time , so that they could hear far off a flower - girl ' s laugh outside Charing Cross , and someone whistling furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets off the Strand . Then the Captain , with a movement so sudden that it might have been passion or play - acting , took Sir Wilson Seymour by the throat . Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear . " You need not kill me ," he said in a voice quite cold ; " I shall do that on my own account ." The Captain ' s hand hesitated and dropped ; and the other added with the same icy candour : " If I find I haven ' t the nerve to do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink ." " Drink isn ' t good enough for me ," replied Cutler , " but I ' ll have blood for this before I die . Not yours -- but I think I know whose ." And before the others could appreciate his intention he snatched	l
their innocence . " We had better all be going ," said Seymour heavily ; " we have done all we can to help ." " Will you understand my motives ," asked Father Brown quietly , " if I say you have done all you can to hurt ?" They both started as if guiltily , and Cutler said sharply : " To hurt whom ?" " To hurt yourselves ," answered the priest . " I would not add to your troubles if it weren ' t common justice to warn you . You ' ve done nearly	s
public man than the judge , he conveyed exactly the fine shade of self - effacement before the King ' s justice ; and though everyone looked at him as they would at the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury , they could have said nothing of his part in it but that it was that of a private gentleman , with an accent on the noun . He was also refreshingly lucid , as he was on the committees . He had been calling on Miss Rome at the theatre ; he had met Captain Cutler there ;	s
, during which the witness looked down , and for all his usual composure seemed to have more than his usual pallor . Then the barrister said in a lower voice , which seemed at once sympathetic and creepy : " Did you see it distinctly ?" Sir Wilson Seymour , however moved , had his excellent brains in full working - order . " Very distinctly as regards its outline , but quite indistinctly , indeed not at all , as regards the details inside the outline . The passage is of such length that anyone in the middle	s
had been torn away from him . Cowdray was resuming his seat with his solemn face , smoothing his black silk robes , and white silk whiskers . Sir Wilson was leaving the witness - box , after a few final particulars to which there were many other witnesses , when the counsel for the defence sprang up and stopped him . " I shall only detain you a moment ," said Mr Butler , who was a rustic - looking person with red eyebrows and an expression of partial slumber . " Will you tell his lordship how you	s
may have been bending forward ," said Cutler , in a hoarse and rather faint voice . " Or again , he may not ," said Mr Butler , and sat down suddenly for the second time . The third , witness called by Sir Walter Cowdray was the little Catholic clergyman , so little , compared with the others , that his head seemed hardly to come above the box , so that it was like cross - examining a child . But unfortunately Sir Walter had somehow got it into his head ( mostly by some ramifications of his family ' s religion ) that Father Brown was on the side of the prisoner , because the prisoner was wicked and foreign and even partly black . Therefore he took Father Brown up sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried to explain anything ; and told him to answer yes or no , and tell the plain facts without any jesuitry . When Father Brown began , in his simplicity , to say who he thought the man in the passage was , the barrister told him that he did not want his theories . " A black shape	l
equally valueless ," replied Brown . " Blood flows , fast or slow , in dead folk or living , for so many more million reasons than we can ever know . Blood will have to flow very funnily ; blood will have to flow up the Matterhorn , before I will take it as a sign that I am to shed it ." " The method ," remarked the other , " has been guaranteed by some of the greatest American men of science ." " What sentimentalists men of science are !" exclaimed Father Brown , " and	s
some confederate ' s clothes which did not fit him . Second , there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running ; so that I must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair , if the hair had not been very short . Then I remembered that beyond these ploughed fields he was crossing lay Pilgrim ' s Pond , for which ( you will remember ) the convict was keeping his bullet ; and I sent my walking - stick flying ." " A brilliant piece of rapid deduction ," said Father Brown ; "	s
continued talking in his expansive , radiantly explanatory style . " To begin with , on the face of it , there is no mystery here at all . It is not mysterious , it is not even odd , that a jailbird should take his gun to Pilgrim ' s Pond . Our people aren ' t like the English , who will forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money on hospitals or horses . Last - Trick Todd has made himself big by his own considerable abilities ; and there ' s no doubt that many of those on whom he has shown his abilities would like to show theirs on him with a shot - gun . Todd might easily get dropped by some man he ' d never even heard of ; some labourer he ' d locked out , or some clerk in a business he ' d busted . Last - Trick is a man of mental endowments and a high public character ; but in this country the relations of employers and employed are considerably strained . " That ' s how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian	l
the dark bulk of the left wing , and a figure appeared black against the illuminated interior -- a muffled figure bending forward , evidently peering out into the night . It closed the door behind it , and I saw it was carrying a lantern , which threw a patch of imperfect light on the dress and figure of the wearer . It seemed to be the figure of a woman , wrapped up in a ragged cloak and evidently disguised to avoid notice ; there was something very strange both about the rags and the furtiveness in a	s
impossible in her having a hanger - on in low life ; or even in her hanging on to him , as I think she must be doing , to judge by the lantern business . If so , the hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand that held the gun . This case , sir , will make a noise ." " Well ," said the priest patiently , " and what did you do next ?" " I reckon you ' ll be shocked ," replied Greywood Usher , " as I know	s
unreliable machine ." " Why , what do you mean ?" asked the detective . " I mean Man ," said Father Brown , " the most unreliable machine I know of . I don ' t want to be rude ; and I don ' t think you will consider Man to be an offensive or inaccurate description of yourself . You say you observed his manner ; but how do you know you observed it right ? You say the words have to come in a natural way ; but how do you know that you did it naturally ? How do you know , if you come to that , that he did not observe your manner ? Who is to prove that you were not tremendously agitated ? There was no machine tied on to your pulse ." " I tell you ," cried the American in the utmost excitement , " I was as cool as a cucumber ." " Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers ," said Brown with a smile . " And almost as cool as you ." " Well , this one wasn ' t ," said Usher ,	l
throwing the papers about . " Oh , you make me tired !" " I ' m sorry ," said the other . " I only point out what seems a reasonable possibility . If you could tell by his manner when the word that might hang him had come , why shouldn ' t he tell from your manner that the word that might hang him was coming ? I should ask for more than words myself before I hanged anybody ." Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph . " And that ,"	s
your innocent man , and there is his innocent record . Even , since then , four criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story . Now what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that ? Hasn ' t the machine done for him ? Or do you prefer to say that the woman and I have done for him ?" " As to what you ' ve done for him ," replied Father Brown , rising and shaking himself in a floppy way , " you ' ve saved him from	s
a shabby green shade shoved up from one of his eyes , both of which were glaring like a tiger ' s . The rest of his face was almost undiscoverable , being masked with a matted beard and whiskers through which the nose could barely thrust itself , and further buried in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief . Mr Usher prided himself on having seen most of the roughest specimens in the State , but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dressed as a scarecrow as this . But , above all , he had	s
-- but I think I know him . Now , you know him -- you know him quite well -- but you don ' t know him -- naturally . Sounds paradoxical , I know ." " I reckon the Cosmos is cracked ," said Usher , and fell asprawl in his round office chair . " Now , see here ," vociferated the stranger , striking the table , but speaking in a voice that was all the more mysterious because it was comparatively mild and rational though still resounding . " I won ' t let you in	s
don ' t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift . Many of our most influential noblemen have not only risen recently , but --" " Oh , stop it !" cried Greywood Usher , wringing one lean hand in impatience against a shade of irony in the other ' s face . " Don ' t stay talking to this lunatic !" cried Todd brutally . " Take me to my friend ." Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression , carrying yet another piece of pink newspaper . " I ' m afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather ," he said , " but this cutting may interest you ." Usher read the headlines , " Last - Trick ' s Strayed Revellers : Mirthful Incident near Pilgrim ' s Pond ." The paragraph went on : " A laughable occurrence took place outside Wilkinson ' s Motor Garage last night . A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins to a man in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness into the steering - seat of a pretty high - toned Panhard ; he was accompanied by a girl wrapped	l
in surprise ; but the girl with the red hair also looked up , and with something that was stronger than astonishment . She was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown sacking stuff ; but she was a lady , and even , on a second glance , a rather needlessly haughty one . " The man with the false nose !" repeated Flambeau . " Who ' s he ?" " I haven ' t a notion ," answered Father Brown . " I want you to find out ; I ask it as a favour .	s
with a heated face , in which there hung a red shadow of anger ; then , despite her anxieties , humour broke out of her eyes and the corners of her mouth , and she answered almost grimly : " Well , if you ' re so keen on my conversation , perhaps you ' ll answer my question ." After a pause she added : " I had the honour to ask you why you thought the man ' s nose was false ." " The wax always spots like that just a little in this weather ,"	s
my tale ; but I tell you it was Philip Hawker , because I am telling you everything . We used to go shrimping together , and said and thought we were in love with each other ; at least he certainly said he was , and I certainly thought I was . If I tell you he had bronzed curly hair and a falconish sort of face , bronzed by the sea also , it ' s not for his sake , I assure you , but for the story ; for it was the cause of a very	s
Roman Empire on my back as well as the Carstairs pedigree . It was not only the old lion argent that was roaring in my ear , but all the eagles of the Caesars seemed flapping and screaming in pursuit of me . And yet my heart rose higher and higher like a child ' s kite , until I came over the loose , dry sand - hills and to the flat , wet sands , where Philip stood already up to his ankles in the shallow shining water , some hundred yards out to sea . There was	s
gulls , or at any of the people who still strayed here and there on the shore between us . Nevertheless , whatever my start sprang from was prophetic ; for , as I gazed , he started walking briskly in a bee - line towards us across the wide wet sands . As he drew nearer and nearer I saw that he was dark and bearded , and that his eyes were marked with dark spectacles . He was dressed poorly but respectably in black , from the old black top hat on his head to the solid black	s
the cheek - bones . His complexion was neither sallow nor livid , but on the contrary rather clear and youthful ; yet this gave a pink - and - white wax look which somehow ( I don ' t know why ) rather increased the horror . The only oddity one could fix was that his nose , which was otherwise of a good shape , was just slightly turned sideways at the tip ; as if , when it was soft , it had been tapped on one side with a toy hammer . The thing was hardly a deformity ; yet I cannot tell you what a living nightmare it was to me . As he stood there in the sunset - stained water he affected me as some hellish sea - monster just risen roaring out of a sea like blood . I don ' t know why a touch on the nose should affect my imagination so much . I think it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finger . And as if he had just that moment moved it . "` Any little assistance ,' he continued with the same	l
own house with my head in a whirl ; it had not begun to clear when I came to the doorstep , on which I found a milk - can -- and the man with the twisted nose . The milk - can told me the servants were all out ; for , of course , Arthur , browsing about in his brown dressing - gown in a brown study , would not hear or answer a bell . Thus there was no one to help me in the house , except my brother , whose help must be my ruin . In desperation I thrust two shillings into the horrid thing ' s hand , and told him to call again in a few days , when I had thought it out . He went off sulking , but more sheepishly than I had expected -- perhaps he had been shaken by his fall -- and I watched the star of sand splashed on his back receding down the road with a horrid vindictive pleasure . He turned a corner some six houses down . " Then I let myself in , made myself some tea , and tried	l
about pale - faced phantoms in the dark ; but this was more dreadful than anything of that kind could ever be . Because , though he cast a long evening shadow , he still stood in warm sunlight . And because his face was not pale , but had that waxen bloom still upon it that belongs to a barber ' s dummy . He stood quite still , with his face towards me ; and I can ' t tell you how horrid he looked among the tulips and all those tall , gaudy , almost hothouse - looking flowers . It looked as if we ' d stuck up a waxwork instead of a statue in the centre of our garden . " Yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turned and ran out of the garden by the back gate , which stood open and by which he had undoubtedly entered . This renewed timidity on his part was so different from the impudence with which he had walked into the sea , that I felt vaguely comforted . I fancied , perhaps , that he feared confronting Arthur more than	l
I knew . Anyhow , I settled down at last , and had a quiet dinner alone ( for it was against the rules to disturb Arthur when he was rearranging the museum ), and , my thoughts , a little released , fled to Philip and lost themselves , I suppose . Anyhow , I was looking blankly , but rather pleasantly than otherwise , at another window , uncurtained , but by this time black as a slate with the final night - fall . It seemed to me that something like a snail was on the outside	s
brother who ' s been in trouble before , who ' s come back so suddenly and who ' s just the man to have shabby confederates . But I can ' t see how he can come into the thing by any process of thought , unless ..." " Well ?" asked his companion patiently . Flambeau lowered his voice . " Unless the girl ' s lover comes in , too , and he would be the blacker villain . The Australian chap did know that Hawker wanted the coin . But I can ' t see how on earth he could know that Hawker had got it , unless Hawker signalled to him or his representative across the shore ." " That is true ," assented the priest , with respect . " Have you noted another thing ?" went on Flambeau eagerly . " this Hawker hears his love insulted , but doesn ' t strike till he ' s got to the soft sand - hills , where he can be victor in a mere sham - fight . If he ' d struck amid rocks and sea , he might have hurt his ally	l
," observed Brown confidently , " don ' t you think it ' s the best thing she can do to stop outside -- with you to look after her ? You see , I rather guess you have guessed it all yourself ." " Yes ," said the young man , in an undertone , " I guessed on the sands and now I know ; that was why I let him fall soft ." Taking a latchkey from the girl and the coin from Hawker , Flambeau let himself and his friend into the empty house and passed	s
aristocracy entirely for its champagne and diamonds . Most men rather admire the nobs for having a good time , but I think we surrender too much when we admit that aristocracy has made even the aristocrats happy . I suggest a series of articles pointing out how dreary , how inhuman , how downright diabolist , is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses . There are plenty of instances ; but you couldn ' t begin with a better one than the Ear of the Eyres . By the end of the week I	s
was a sound piece of slashing invective about the evil secrets of princes , and despair in the high places of the earth . Though written violently , it was in excellent English ; but the editor , as usual , had given to somebody else the task of breaking it up into sub - headings , which were of a spicier sort , as " Peeress and Poisons ", and " The Eerie Ear ", " The Eyres in their Eyrie ", and so on through a hundred happy changes . Then followed the legend of the Ear ,	s
and two barns ; thatched all over with the thatch that looks like brown and grey hair grown before history . But outside the door was a sign which called it the Blue Dragon ; and under the sign was one of those long rustic tables that used to stand outside most of the free English inns , before teetotallers and brewers between them destroyed freedom . And at this table sat three gentlemen , who might have lived a hundred years ago . Now that I know them all better , there is no difficulty about disentangling the impressions	s
like it . The curse of the Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country , and many have suffered from it . They know there are none who have suffered from it as I have ." And with that he crushed a piece of the fallen glass under his heel , and strode away among the green twilight of the twinkling apple - trees . " That is an extraordinary old gentleman ," I said to the other two ; " do you happen to know what the Exmoor family has done to him ? Who is he ?" The big man in black was staring at me with the wild air of a baffled bull ; he did not at first seem to take it in . Then he said at last , " Don ' t you know who he is ?" I reaffirmed my ignorance , and there was another silence ; then the little priest said , still looking at the table , " That is the Duke of Exmoor ." Then , before I could collect my scattered senses , he added equally quietly , but with an air of regularizing things :	l
poor Duke than giving him away . Didn ' t you ever hear of the time when he very nearly lost all the estates ?" The priest shook his head ; and the librarian proceeded to tell the tale as he had heard it from his predecessor in the same post , who had been his patron and instructor , and whom he seemed to trust implicitly . Up to a certain point it was a common enough tale of the decline of a great family ' s fortunes -- the tale of a family lawyer . His lawyer , however , had the sense to cheat honestly , if the expression explains itself . Instead of using funds he held in trust , he took advantage of the Duke ' s carelessness to put the family in a financial hole , in which it might be necessary for the Duke to let him hold them in reality . The lawyer ' s name was Isaac Green , but the Duke always called him Elisha ; presumably in reference to the fact that he was quite bald , though certainly not more than thirty . He had risen very rapidly	l
Midas ," went on the priest , with a cheerful simplicity which somehow seemed rather flippant under the circumstances . " I can quite understand that it ' s nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather flaps . But if he wants to use hair , why doesn ' t he make it look like hair ? There never was hair of that colour in this world . It looks more like a sunset - cloud coming through the wood . Why doesn ' t he conceal the family curse better , if he '	s
blood , he doesn ' t conceal his family curse , he doesn ' t conceal the family crimes -- but --" The little man ' s voice changed so suddenly , he shut his hand so sharply , and his eyes so rapidly grew rounder and brighter like a waking owl ' s , that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion on the table . " But ," he ended , " he does really conceal his toilet ." It somehow completed the thrill of my fanciful nerves that at that instant the Duke appeared again silently among the glimmering trees , with his soft foot and sunset - hued hair , coming round the corner of the house in company with his librarian . Before he came within earshot , Father Brown had added quite composedly , " Why does he really hide the secret of what he does with the purple wig ? Because it isn ' t the sort of secret we suppose ." The Duke came round the corner and resumed his seat at the head of the table with all his native dignity . The embarrassment of the librarian left him	l
twelve years ago . I think it very typical of the real case against our aristocracy as it is , and as it will be till God sends us braver men . Mr Nutt put down the manuscript and called out with unusual sharpness : " Miss Barlow , please take down a letter to Mr Finn ." DEAR FINN ,-- You must be mad ; we can ' t touch this . I wanted vampires and the bad old days and aristocracy hand - in - hand with superstition . They like that But you must know the Exmoors	s
shipwreck ; and one at least , to my own knowledge , on practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard ." " What a pity !" exclaimed Flambeau . " She ' s going ." " When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history ?" asked Father Brown , as the girl in the canoe paddled off , without showing the least intention of extending her interest from the tower to the yacht , which Fanshaw had already caused to lie alongside the island . " Many years ago ," replied Fanshaw ; " he hasn ' t been to sea for some time now , though he is as keen on it as ever . I believe there ' s a family compact or something . Well , here ' s the landing stage ; let ' s come ashore and see the old boy ." They followed him on to the island , just under the tower , and Father Brown , whether from the mere touch of dry land , or the interest of something on the other bank of the river ( which he stared at very hard for	l
had made and came down again with a more ponderous slash , splitting the fissiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise . Then it was pulled out again , flashed above the fence some feet further along , and again split it halfway down with the first stroke ; and after waggling a little to extricate itself ( accompanied with curses in the darkness ) split it down to the ground with a second . Then a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square of thin wood flying into the pathway , and a great gap	s
piratical Admiral ; though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents . For instance , he wore a broad - brimmed hat as protection against the sun ; but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky , and the two corners pulled down lower than the ears , so that it stood across his forehead in a crescent like the old cocked hat worn by Nelson . He wore an ordinary dark - blue jacket , with nothing special about the buttons , but the combination of it with white linen trousers somehow had	s
flanked with two of those half - featured lumps of stone with holes for eyes that are said to be South Sea idols ; and on the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confused carvings that looked almost as barbaric . As they passed indoors , the little cleric hopped suddenly on to the table , and standing on it peered unaffectedly through his spectacles at the mouldings in the oak . Admiral Pendragon looked very much astonished , though not particularly annoyed ; while Fanshaw was so amused with what looked like a performing pigmy on his little stand , that he could not control his laughter . But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter or the astonishment . He was gazing at three carved symbols , which , though very worn and obscure , seemed still to convey some sense to him . The first seemed to be the outline of some tower or other building , crowned with what looked like curly - pointed ribbons . The second was clearer : an old Elizabethan galley with decorative waves beneath it , but interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged rock	l
tell you there are other versions of the tale , and much more horrible ones . One story credits my unfortunate ancestor with having had the Spaniard cut in two ; and that will fit the pretty picture also . Another obligingly credits our family with the possession of a tower full of snakes and explains those little , wriggly things in that way . And a third theory supposes the crooked line on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt ; but that alone , if seriously examined , would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences	s
finally whether the curse was truth or trash . If all the Pendragons sailed about anyhow , he thought there would be too much chance of natural catastrophes to prove anything . But if we went to sea one at a time in strict order of succession to the property , he thought it might show whether any connected fate followed the family as a family . It was a silly notion , I think , and I quarrelled with my father pretty heartily ; for I was an ambitious man and was left to the last , coming ,	s
not quite so easy about the flaming tower as you try to be ." Admiral Pendragon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen ; but he sat quite still , and when he spoke again it was in a lower voice . " You do it at your own peril ," he said ; " but wouldn ' t you be an atheist to keep sane in all this devilry ?" Some three hours afterwards Fanshaw , Flambeau and the priest were still dawdling about the garden in the dark ; and it began to dawn on the other two that Father Brown had no intention of going to bed either in the tower or the house . " I think the lawn wants weeding ," said he dreamily . " If I could find a spud or something I ' d do it myself ." They followed him , laughing and half remonstrating ; but he replied with the utmost solemnity , explaining to them , in a maddening little sermon , that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others . He did not find a spud ; but he found an	l
old broom made of twigs , with which he began energetically to brush the fallen leaves off the grass . " Always some little thing to be done ," he said with idiotic cheerfulness ; " as George Herbert says : ` Who sweeps an Admiral ' s garden in Cornwall as for Thy laws makes that and the action fine .' And now ," he added , suddenly slinging the broom away , " Let ' s go and water the flowers ." With the same mixed emotions they watched him uncoil some considerable lengths of the large garden	s
of the hairy gardener appeared on a higher ridge of the trenched and terraced lawn , hailing them with a brandished rake and a horribly bellowing voice . " Put down that hose ," he shouted ; " put down that hose and go to your --" " I am fearfully clumsy ," replied the reverend gentleman weakly ; " do you know , I upset some wine at dinner ." He made a wavering half - turn of apology towards the gardener , with the hose still spouting in his hand . The gardener caught the cold crash of	s
like the laughter of devils . " My God ! what is this ?" cried Sir Cecil Fanshaw . " The sign of the flaming tower ," said Father Brown , and sent the driving water from his hose into the heart of the red patch . " Lucky we hadn ' t gone to bed !" ejaculated Fanshaw . " I suppose it can ' t spread to the house ." " You may remember ," said the priest quietly , " that the wooden fence that might have carried it was cut away ." Flambeau turned electrified eyes	s
upon his friend , but Fanshaw only said rather absently : " Well , nobody can be killed , anyhow ." " This is rather a curious kind of tower ," observed Father Brown , " when it takes to killing people , it always kills people who are somewhere else ." At the same instant the monstrous figure of the gardener with the streaming beard stood again on the green ridge against the sky , waving others to come on ; but now waving not a rake but a cutlass . Behind him came the two negroes , also with the old crooked cutlasses out of the trophy . But in the blood - red glare , with their black faces and yellow figures , they looked like devils carrying instruments of torture . In the dim garden behind them a distant voice was heard calling out brief directions . When the priest heard the voice , a terrible change came over his countenance . But he remained composed ; and never took his eye off the patch of flame which had begun by spreading , but now seemed to shrink a little as it hissed under the torch	l
paddles of a canoe ; the girl ' s voice giving orders , the voices of gipsies answering and coming nearer , the plumping and sucking noise of empty buckets plunged into a full stream ; and finally the sound of many feet around the fire . But all this was less to him than the fact that the red rent , which had lately once more increased , had once more slightly diminished . Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head . Flambeau and Fanshaw , now reinforced by some of the gipsies ,	s
. " I felt simply horrible . But feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things ." And he closed his eyes . " Do you think most men would have seen that ?" asked Flambeau . He received no answer : Father Brown was asleep . IX . The God of the Gongs IT was one of those chilly and empty afternoons in early winter , when the daylight is silver rather than gold and pewter rather than silver . If it was dreary in a hundred bleak offices and yawning drawing - rooms , it was drearier still along the edges of the flat Essex coast , where the monotony was the more inhuman for being broken at very long intervals by a lamp - post that looked less civilized than a tree , or a tree that looked more ugly than a lamp - post . A light fall of snow had half - melted into a few strips , also looking leaden rather than silver , when it had been fixed again by the seal of frost ; no fresh snow had fallen , but a ribbon of the old snow ran along the	l
with Brighton and the old ones . This must be Seawood , I think -- Lord Pooley ' s experiment ; he had the Sicilian Singers down at Christmas , and there ' s talk about holding one of the great glove - fights here . But they ' ll have to chuck the rotten place into the sea ; it ' s as dreary as a lost railway - carriage ." They had come under the big bandstand , and the priest was looking up at it with a curiosity that had something rather odd about it , his head a little on one side , like a bird ' s . It was the conventional , rather tawdry kind of erection for its purpose : a flattened dome or canopy , gilt here and there , and lifted on six slender pillars of painted wood , the whole being raised about five feet above the parade on a round wooden platform like a drum . But there was something fantastic about the snow combined with something artificial about the gold that haunted Flambeau as well as his friend with some association he could not capture , but which	l
he knew was at once artistic and alien . " I ' ve got it ," he said at last . " It ' s Japanese . It ' s like those fanciful Japanese prints , where the snow on the mountain looks like sugar , and the gilt on the pagodas is like gilt on gingerbread . It looks just like a little pagan temple ." " Yes ," said Father Brown . " Let ' s have a look at the god ." And with an agility hardly to be expected of him , he hopped up on	s
spectral in its melancholy . They both felt vaguely that if any food or drink were offered at such a hostelry , it would be the paste - board ham and empty mug of the pantomime . In this , however , they were not altogether confirmed . As they drew nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet , which was apparently closed , one of the iron garden - seats with curly backs that had adorned the gardens , but much longer , running almost the whole length of the frontage . Presumably	s
waiters are all Italians , you see , and I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black , if he really can do it . You know the great fight between Malvoli and Nigger Ned is coming off after all ?" " I ' m afraid we can ' t wait to trouble your hospitality seriously ," said Father Brown . " But my friend would be glad of a glass of sherry , I ' m sure , to keep out the cold and drink success to the Latin champion ." Flambeau did not	s
the doorway . He was buttoned and buckled up to his bursting eyeballs in the most brilliant fashion . A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head -- a hat of the sort that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors . But somehow the black man was like the black hat . He also was black , and yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more . It is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside his waistcoat . The red flower stood up	s
fixed at the throat rather in the way that nurses fix children ' s comforters with a safety - pin . Only this ," added the priest , gazing placidly out to sea , " was not a safety - pin ." The man sitting on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly out to sea . Now he was once more in repose . Flambeau felt quite certain that one of his eyes was naturally larger than the other . Both were now well opened , and he could almost fancy the left eye grew larger as he	s
gazed . " It was a very long gold pin , and had the carved head of a monkey or some such thing ," continued the cleric ; " and it was fixed in a rather odd way -- he wore pince - nez and a broad black --" The motionless man continued to gaze at the sea , and the eyes in his head might have belonged to two different men . Then he made a movement of blinding swiftness . Father Brown had his back to him , and in that flash might have fallen dead on his face . Flambeau had no weapon , but his large brown hands were resting on the end of the long iron seat . His shoulders abruptly altered their shape , and he heaved the whole huge thing high over his head , like a headsman ' s axe about to fall . The mere height of the thing , as he held it vertical , looked like a long iron ladder by which he was inviting men to climb towards the stars . But the long shadow , in the level evening light , looked like a giant brandishing the	l
Eiffel Tower . It was the shock of that shadow , before the shock of the iron crash , that made the stranger quail and dodge , and then dart into his inn , leaving the flat and shining dagger he had dropped exactly where it had fallen . " We must get away from here instantly ," cried Flambeau , flinging the huge seat away with furious indifference on the beach . He caught the little priest by the elbow and ran him down a grey perspective of barren back garden , at the end of which there was	s
a closed back garden door . Flambeau bent over it an instant in violent silence , and then said : " The door is locked ." As he spoke a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell , brushing the brim of his hat . It startled him more than the small and distant detonation that had come just before . Then came another distant detonation , and the door he was trying to open shook under the bullet buried in it . Flambeau ' s shoulders again filled out and altered suddenly . Three hinges and a lock burst at the same instant , and he went out into the empty path behind , carrying the great garden door with him , as Samson carried the gates of Gaza . Then he flung the garden door over the garden wall , just as a third shot picked up a spurt of snow and dust behind his heel . Without ceremony he snatched up the little priest , slung him astraddle on his shoulders , and went racing towards Seawood as fast as his long legs could carry him . It was not until nearly two miles farther	l
you have so accurately described ." " I did meet him in a way ," Brown said , biting his finger rather nervously --" I did really . And it was too dark to see him properly , because it was under that bandstand affair . But I ' m afraid I didn ' t describe him so very accurately after all , for his pince - nez was broken under him , and the long gold pin wasn ' t stuck through his purple scarf but through his heart ." " And I suppose ," said the other in a lower voice , " that glass - eyed guy had something to do with it ." " I had hoped he had only a little ," answered Brown in a rather troubled voice , " and I may have been wrong in what I did . I acted on impulse . But I fear this business has deep roots and dark ." They walked on through some streets in silence . The yellow lamps were beginning to be lit in the cold blue twilight , and they were evidently approaching the more central parts of the town . Highly	l
of such a scene . I remember once taking a tramp in your glorious Surrey hills , thinking of nothing but gorse and skylarks , when I came out on a vast circle of land , and over me lifted a vast , voiceless structure , tier above tier of seats , as huge as a Roman amphitheatre and as empty as a new letter - rack . A bird sailed in heaven over it . It was the Grand Stand at Epsom . And I felt that no one would ever be happy there again ." " It ' s odd you should mention Epsom ," said the priest . " Do you remember what was called the Sutton Mystery , because two suspected men -- ice - cream men , I think -- happened to live at Sutton ? They were eventually released . A man was found strangled , it was said , on the Downs round that part . As a fact , I know ( from an Irish policeman who is a friend of mine ) that he was found close up to the Epsom Grand Stand -- in fact , only hidden by one	l
of the lower doors being pushed back ." " That is queer ," assented Flambeau . " But it rather confirms my view that such pleasure places look awfully lonely out of season , or the man wouldn ' t have been murdered there ." " I ' m not so sure he --" began Brown , and stopped . " Not so sure he was murdered ?" queried his companion . " Not so sure he was murdered out of the season ," answered the little priest , with simplicity . " Don ' t you think there '	s
rather apoplectic faces that are produced by a prolonged attempt to combine the oriental climate with the occidental luxuries . But the face was a good - humoured one , and even now , though evidently puzzled and inquisitive , wore a kind of innocent grin . He had a large palm - leaf hat on the back of his head ( suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face ), but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas ; which , though glowing enough to behold , must have been , on a fresh morning , pretty chilly to wear . He had evidently come out of his house in a hurry , and the priest was not surprised when he called out without further ceremony : " Did you hear that noise ?" " Yes ," answered Father Brown ; " I thought I had better look in , in case anything was the matter ." The Major looked at him rather queerly with his good - humoured gooseberry eyes . " What do you think the noise was ?" he asked . " It	l
white with a light lemon - yellow stripe . The man was haggard , but handsome , more sunburned than the other ; he had an aquiline profile and rather deep - sunken eyes , and a slight air of oddity arising from the combination of coal - black hair with a much lighter moustache . All this Father Brown absorbed in detail more at leisure . For the moment he only saw one thing about the man ; which was the revolver in his hand . " Cray !" exclaimed the Major , staring at him ; " did you fire that shot ?" " Yes , I did ," retorted the black - haired gentleman hotly ; " and so would you in my place . If you were chased everywhere by devils and nearly --" The Major seemed to intervene rather hurriedly . " This is my friend Father Brown ," he said . And then to Brown : " I don ' t know whether you ' ve met Colonel Cray of the Royal Artillery ." " I have heard of him , of course ," said the priest innocently . " Did you -- did	l
shirt and trousers , with a crimson cummerbund , and a light square jacket over all ; thus normally set off , his red festive face seemed bursting with a commonplace cordiality . He was indeed emphatic , but then he was talking to his cook -- the swarthy son of Malta , whose lean , yellow and rather careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow - white cap and costume . The cook might well be careworn , for cookery was the Major ' s hobby . He was one of those amateurs who always know more than the	s
But you are trying to find traces of the burglar ; even when there aren ' t any . You are struggling against it . You want what no madman ever wants ." " And what is that ?" " You want to be proved wrong ," said Brown . During the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet and was regarding the cleric with agitated eyes . " By hell , but that is a true word !" he cried . " They are all at me here that the fellow was only after the silver -- as if I shouldn ' t be only too pleased to think so ! She ' s been at me ," and he tossed his tousled black head towards Audrey , but the other had no need of the direction , " she ' s been at me today about how cruel I was to shoot a poor harmless house - breaker , and how I have the devil in me against poor harmless natives . But I was a good - natured man once -- as good - natured as Putnam ." After a pause he said :	l
" Look here , I ' ve never seen you before ; but you shall judge of the whole story . Old Putnam and I were friends in the same mess ; but , owing to some accidents on the Afghan border , I got my command much sooner than most men ; only we were both invalided home for a bit . I was engaged to Audrey out there ; and we all travelled back together . But on the journey back things happened . Curious things . The result of them was that Putnam wants it broken off	s
be tortured and die . If you had seen the Monkey ' s Face , still we should be very moderate , very tolerant -- you would only be tortured and live . But as you have seen the Monkey ' s Tail , we must pronounce the worst sentence . which is -- Go Free .' " When he said the words I heard the elaborate iron latch with which I had struggled , automatically unlock itself : and then , far down the dark passages I had passed , I heard the heavy street - door shifting its	s
trick was the trick of a white man . There is only one weapon that will bring blood with that mere feathery touch : a razor held by a white man . There is one way of making a common room full of invisible , overpowering poison : turning on the gas -- the crime of a white man . And there is only one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window , turn in mid - air and come back to the window next to it : the Australian boomerang . You ' ll see	s
s theory ( which was that of a comparatively stationary universe visited occasionally by convulsions of change ) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford , and got so far as to be named " Catastrophism ". But many American papers seized on the challenge as a great event ; and the Sun threw the shadow of Mr Boulnois quite gigantically across its pages . By the paradox already noted , articles of valuable intelligence and enthusiasm were presented with headlines apparently written by an illiterate maniac , headlines such as " Darwin Chews Dirt ; Critic Boulnois says He Jumps the Shocks "-- or " Keep Catastrophic , says Thinker Boulnois ." And Mr Calhoun Kidd , of the Western Sun , was bidden to take his butterfly tie and lugubrious visage down to the little house outside Oxford where Thinker Boulnois lived in happy ignorance of such a title . That fated philosopher had consented , in a somewhat dazed manner , to receive the interviewer , and had named the hour of nine that evening . The last of a summer sunset clung about Cumnor and the low wooded hills ; the romantic Yankee was both doubtful	l
guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be intimate friends . Such , according to Dalroy ' s account , was nevertheless the fact . The two had hunted in couples at school and college , and , though their social destinies had been very different ( for Champion was a great landlord and almost a millionaire , while Boulnois was a poor scholar and , until just lately , an unknown one ), they still kept in very close touch with each other . Indeed , Boulnois ' s cottage stood just outside the gates of Pendragon	s
set off , stumping up the long avenue of black pine - woods that pointed in abrupt perspective towards the inner gardens of Pendragon Park . The trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse ; there were still a few stars . He was a man with more literary than direct natural associations ; the word " Ravenswood " came into his head repeatedly . It was partly the raven colour of the pine - woods ; but partly also an indescribable atmosphere almost described in Scott ' s great tragedy ; the smell of something that died in the eighteenth century ; the smell of dank gardens and broken urns , of wrongs that will never now be righted ; of something that is none the less incurably sad because it is strangely unreal . More than once , as he went up that strange , black road of tragic artifice , he stopped , startled , thinking he heard steps in front of him . He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre walls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them . At first he thought he must have	l
but he did not realize as yet that this was because he was coming nearer to the lights of the great house and garden . He only felt that the atmosphere was growing more intense , there was in the sadness more violence and secrecy -- more -- he hesitated for the word , and then said it with a jerk of laughter -- Catastrophism . More pines , more pathway slid past him , and then he stood rooted as by a blast of magic . It is vain to say that he felt as if he had got into a dream ; but this time he felt quite certain that he had got into a book . For we human beings are used to inappropriate things ; we are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous ; it is a tune to which we can go to sleep . If one appropriate thing happens , it wakes us up like the pang of a perfect chord . Something happened such as would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale . Over the black pine - wood came flying and flashing in the moon a naked	l
sword -- such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park . It fell on the pathway far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle . He ran like a hare and bent to look at it . Seen at close quarters it had rather a showy look : the big red jewels in the hilt and guard were a little dubious . But there were other red drops upon the blade which were not dubious . He looked round wildly in the direction from which	s
down the steep bank and lay at the American ' s feet , faintly moving one arm . A gaudy , unnatural gold ornament on the arm suddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo and Juliet ; of course the tight crimson suit was part of the play . But there was a long red stain down the bank from which the man had rolled -- that was no part of the play . He had been run through the body . Mr Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again . Once more he seemed to hear phantasmal footsteps , and started to find another figure already near him . He knew the figure , and yet it terrified him . The dissipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet way with him ; if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made , Dalroy had a sinister air of keeping appointments that hadn ' t . The moonlight discoloured everything , against Dalroy ' s red hair his wan face looked not so much white as pale green . All this morbid impressionism must be Kidd ' s excuse for having cried out , brutally and beyond all	l
glass or steel . These were on a polished surface . They were half - way down the blade of the sword . Whose prints they were I have no earthly clue ; but why should anybody hold a sword half - way down ? It was a long sword , but length is an advantage in lunging at an enemy . At least , at most enemies . At all enemies except one ." " Except one ," she repeated . " There is only one enemy ," said Father Brown , " whom it is easier to kill	s
could find no crack in his great skull to get in by . Well , John was to come and see us act this evening , but just as we were starting he said he wouldn ' t ; he had got an interesting book and a cigar . I told this to Sir Claude , and it was his death - blow . The monomaniac suddenly saw despair . He stabbed himself , crying out like a devil that Boulnois was slaying him ; he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy ,	s
, wondering . " Right , right !" rejoined the cleric energetically , and set off scuttling up the path towards the Park gates . He turned once to say : " Better get hold of that Yankee , or ` Crime of John Boulnois ' will be all over the Republic in large letters ." " You don ' t understand ," said Mrs Boulnois . " He wouldn ' t mind . I don ' t think he imagines that America really is a place ." When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and the drowsy	s
. I opened the front door , and there was a little man with his mouth open to speak and his notebook open to write in . I remembered the Yankee interviewer I had forgotten . His hair was parted in the middle , and I tell you that murder --" " I understand ," said Father Brown . " I ' ve seen him ." " I didn ' t commit murder ," continued the Catastrophist mildly , " but only perjury . I said I had gone across to Pendragon Park and shut the door in his face . That is my crime , Father Brown , and I don ' t know what penance you would inflict for it ." " I shan ' t inflict any penance ," said the clerical gentleman , collecting his heavy hat and umbrella with an air of some amusement ; " quite the contrary . I came here specially to let you off the little penance which would otherwise have followed your little offence ." " And what ," asked Boulnois , smiling , " is the little penance I have so luckily been let off ?" " Being hanged	l
. But he never composed anything in the form of fiction , unless it be the tale that follows : " I wonder ," he said , " whether one would have real adventures in a place like this , if one put oneself in the way ? It ' s a splendid back - scene for them , but I always have a kind of feeling that they would fight you with pasteboard sabres more than real , horrible swords ." " You are mistaken ," said his friend . " In this place they not only fight with swords , but kill without swords . And there ' s worse than that ." " Why , what do you mean ?" asked Father Brown . " Why ," replied the other , " I should say this was the only place in Europe where a man was ever shot without firearms ." " Do you mean a bow and arrow ?" asked Brown in some wonder . " I mean a bullet in the brain ," replied Flambeau . " Don ' t you know the story of the late Prince of this place ? It was one	l
all the other rooms , and even in this he erected another sort of central cabin or cupboard , lined with steel , like a safe or a battleship . Some say that under the floor of this again was a secret hole in the earth , no more than large enough to hold him , so that , in his anxiety to avoid the grave , he was willing to go into a place pretty much like it . But he went further yet . The populace had been supposed to be disarmed ever since the suppression of the	s
revolt , but Otto now insisted , as governments very seldom insist , on an absolute and literal disarmament . It was carried out , with extraordinary thoroughness and severity , by very well - organized officials over a small and familiar area , and , so far as human strength and science can be absolutely certain of anything , Prince Otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as a toy pistol into Heiligwaldenstein ." " Human science can never be quite certain of things like that ," said Father Brown , still looking at the red budding of the branches over his head , " if only because of the difficulty about definition and connotation . What is a weapon ? People have been murdered with the mildest domestic comforts ; certainly with tea - kettles , probably with tea - cosies . On the other hand , if you showed an Ancient Briton a revolver , I doubt if he would know it was a weapon -- until it was fired into him , of course . Perhaps somebody introduced a firearm so new that it didn ' t even look like a firearm .	l
realized suddenly that he could do without them . " His great passion was not the much nobler dread of death , but the strange desire of gold . For this legend of the gold he had left Grossenmark and invaded Heiligwaldenstein . For this and only this he had bought the traitor and butchered the hero , for this he had long questioned and cross - questioned the false Chamberlain , until he had come to the conclusion that , touching his ignorance , the renegade really told the truth . For this he had , somewhat reluctantly , paid and promised money on the chance of gaining the larger amount ; and for this he had stolen out of his palace like a thief in the rain , for he had thought of another way to get the desire of his eyes , and to get it cheap . " Away at the upper end of a rambling mountain path to which he was making his way , among the pillared rocks along the ridge that hangs above the town , stood the hermitage , hardly more than a cavern fenced with thorn , in which the third	l
Behind was the black cave , masked with green thorn , so low that it was hard to believe that a man could enter it . In front was the fall of the cliffs and the vast but cloudy vision of the valley . On the small rock platform stood an old bronze lectern or reading - stand , groaning under a great German Bible . The bronze or copper of it had grown green with the eating airs of that exalted place , and Otto had instantly the thought , " Even if they had arms , they must be rusted by now ." Moonrise had already made a deathly dawn behind the crests and crags , and the rain had ceased . " Behind the lectern , and looking across the valley , stood a very old man in a black robe that fell as straight as the cliffs around him , but whose white hair and weak voice seemed alike to waver in the wind . He was evidently reading some daily lesson as part of his religious exercises . " They trust in their horses ..." "` Sir ,' said the Prince of Heiligwaldenstein , with	l
the frosty silver on the hair , nor the frost - bitten refinement of the features . They were peasants , Croat or Magyar , with broad , blunt visages and blinking eyes . For the first time something troubled the Prince , but his courage and diplomatic sense stood firm . "` I fear we have not met ,' he said , ` since that awful cannonade in which your poor brother died .' "` All my brothers died ,' said the old man , still looking across the valley . Then , for one instant turning on Otto his drooping , delicate features , and the wintry hair that seemed to drip over his eyebrows like icicles , he added : ` You see , I am dead , too .' "` I hope you ' ll understand ,' said the Prince , controlling himself almost to a point of conciliation , ` that I do not come here to haunt you , as a mere ghost of those great quarrels . We will not talk about who was right or wrong in that , but at least there was one point on which we were never wrong	l
mountains . "` He has spoken of gold ,' he said . ` He has spoken of things not lawful . Let him cease to speak .' " Otto had the vice of his Prussian type and tradition , which is to regard success not as an incident but as a quality . He conceived himself and his like as perpetually conquering peoples who were perpetually being conquered . Consequently , he was ill acquainted with the emotion of surprise , and ill prepared for the next movement , which startled and stiffened him . He had opened his mouth to answer the hermit , when the mouth was stopped and the voice strangled by a strong , soft gag suddenly twisted round his head like a tourniquet . It was fully forty seconds before he even realized that the two Hungarian servants had done it , and that they had done it with his own military scarf . " The old man went again weakly to his great brazen - supported Bible , turned over the leaves , with a patience that had something horrible about it , till he came to the Epistle of St James , and	l
, in which place there was nothing to connect him with the disaster ; he was but one of the most loyal and orderly of fifty such sentries within call . She remained by the body and gave the alarm ; and there was nothing to connect her with the disaster either , since she had not got , and could not have , any firearms . " Well ," said Father Brown rising cheerfully " I hope they ' re happy ." " Where are you going ?" asked his friend . " I ' m going to have	s
will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset . It looked like the end of the world . All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage ; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers , and of feathers that almost brushed the face . Across the great part of the dome they were grey , with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green ; but towards the west the whole grew past description , transparent and passionate , and the last red - hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen . The whole was so close about the earth , as to express nothing but a violent secrecy . The very empyrean seemed to be a secret . It expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism . The very sky seemed small . I say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by that oppressive sky . There are others who may remember it because it marked the first appearance in the place of the second	l
poet of Saffron Park . For a long time the red - haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival ; it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended . The new poet , who introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very mild - looking mortal , with a fair , pointed beard and faint , yellow hair . But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked . He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet , Gregory , upon the whole nature of poetry .	s
He said that he ( Syme ) was poet of law , a poet of order ; nay , he said he was a poet of respectability . So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that impossible sky . In fact , Mr . Lucian Gregory , the anarchic poet , connected the two events . " It may well be ," he said , in his sudden lyrical manner , " it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet . You say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms . I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden ." The man with the meek blue eyes and the pale , pointed beard endured these thunders with a certain submissive solemnity . The third party of the group , Gregory ' s sister Rosamond , who had her brother ' s braids of red hair , but a kindlier face underneath them ,	l
An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions . The poet delights in disorder only . If it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway ." " So it is ," said Mr . Syme . " Nonsense !" said Gregory , who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox . " Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ? I will tell you . It is because they know that the train is going right . It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach . It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria , and nothing but Victoria . Oh , their wild rapture ! oh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street !" " It is you who are unpoetical ," replied the poet Syme . " If what you say of clerks is true , they can	l
, " that I am serious about my anarchism ?" " I beg your pardon ?" said Syme . " Am I not serious about my anarchism ?" cried Gregory , with knotted fists . " My dear fellow !" said Syme , and strolled away . With surprise , but with a curious pleasure , he found Rosamond Gregory still in his company . " Mr . Syme ," she said , " do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ?" Syme smiled . " Do you ?" he asked . " What do you mean ?" asked the girl , with grave eyes . " My dear Miss Gregory ," said Syme gently , " there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity . When you say ' thank you ' for the salt , do you mean what you say ? No . When you say ' the world is round ,' do you mean what you say ? No . It is true , but you don ' t mean it . Now , sometimes a man like your brother	l
foot from the lamp - post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the lamp - post itself . The tall hat and long frock coat were black ; the face , in an abrupt shadow , was almost as dark . Only a fringe of fiery hair against the light , and also something aggressive in the attitude , proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory . He had something of the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe . He made a sort of doubtful salute , which Syme somewhat more	s
here to resume our argument , but to end it for ever ." The silence fell again , and Syme , though he understood nothing , listened instinctively for something serious . Gregory began in a smooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile . " Mr . Syme ," he said , " this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable . You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before ." " Indeed !" " Now I remember ," resumed Gregory reflectively , " one other person succeeded in	s
" And in no other sense ," he asked , " you think me serious ? You think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths . You do not think that in a deeper , a more deadly sense , I am serious ." Syme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road . " Serious !" he cried . " Good Lord ! is this street serious ? Are these damned Chinese lanterns serious ? Is the whole caboodle serious ? One comes here and talks a pack of bosh , and perhaps some sense as	s
Ah , here comes your champagne ! I admit that there may be a slight disproportion , let us say , between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior . But that is all our modesty . We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth ." " And who are we ?" asked Syme , emptying his champagne glass . " It is quite simple ," replied Gregory . " We are the serious anarchists , in whom you do not believe ." " Oh !" said Syme shortly . "	s
simple eagerness , " I hope you will abolish them too . They are much more troublesome to me ." " You spoke of a second question ," snapped Gregory . " With pleasure ," resumed Syme . " In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy . I have an aunt who lived over a shop , but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public - house . You have a heavy iron door . You cannot pass it without submitting to the humiliation of	s
am a humanitarian myself , but I have , I hope , enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who , like Nietzsche , admire violence -- the proud , mad war of Nature and all that , you know . I threw myself into the major . I drew my sword and waved it constantly . I called out ' Blood !' abstractedly , like a man calling for wine . I often said , ' Let the weak perish ; it is the Law .' Well , well , it seems majors don ' t do this . I was nabbed again . At last I went in despair to the President of the Central Anarchist Council , who is the greatest man in Europe ." " What is his name ?" asked Syme . " You would not know it ," answered Gregory . " That is his greatness . Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of , and they were heard of . He puts all his genius into not being heard of , and he is not heard of . But you cannot be for five minutes in the	l
, do you ? You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless ; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ?' I nodded . He suddenly lifted his lion ' s voice . ' Why , then , dress up as an anarchist , you fool !' he roared so that the room shook . ' Nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then .' And he turned his broad back on me without another word . I took his advice , and have never regretted it . I preached blood and murder to those women day and night , and -- by God !-- they would let me wheel their perambulators ." Syme sat watching him with some respect in his large , blue eyes . " You took me in ," he said . " It is really a smart dodge ." Then after a pause he added -- " What do you call this tremendous President of yours ?" " We generally call him Sunday ," replied Gregory with simplicity . ' You see , there are seven members of the Central Anarchist Council , and they are named	l
" then I snatch up this cloak and stick , stuff these other things into my pocket , step out of a door in this cavern , which opens on the river , where there is a steam - tug already waiting for me , and then -- then -- oh , the wild joy of being Thursday !" And he clasped his hands . Syme , who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor , got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation . " Why is it ," he asked vaguely , " that I think you are quite a decent fellow ? Why do I positively like you , Gregory ?" He paused a moment , and then added with a sort of fresh curiosity , " Is it because you are such an ass ?" There was a thoughtful silence again , and then he cried out -- " Well , damn it all ! this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my life , and I am going to act accordingly . Gregory , I gave you a promise before I came into this place .	l
Shame !" cried Witherspoon . " Why not ?" " Comrade Witherspoon ," said Gregory , with a feverish gaiety , " is anxious to know why nobody eats him ( laughter ). In our society , at any rate , which loves him sincerely , which is founded upon love --" " No , no !" said Witherspoon , " down with love ." " Which is founded upon love ," repeated Gregory , grinding his teeth , " there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body , or which I should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body . Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society , we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure , the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity ." Gregory resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead . The silence was sudden and awkward , but the chairman rose like an automaton , and said in a colourless voice -- " Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory ?" The assembly seemed vague and sub - consciously disappointed ,	l
tone and with a brief simplicity , he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off . " Comrades !" he cried , in a voice that made every man jump out of his boots , " have we come here for this ? Do we live underground like rats in order to listen to talk like this ? This is talk we might listen to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat . Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us , ' Be good , and you will be happy ,' ' Honesty is the best policy ,' and ' Virtue is its own reward '? There was not a word in Comrade Gregory ' s address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure ( hear , hear ). But I am not a curate ( loud cheers ), and I did not listen to it with pleasure ( renewed cheers ). The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make	l
. We are not murderers , we are executioners ( cheers )." Ever since Syme had risen Gregory had sat staring at him , his face idiotic with astonishment . Now in the pause his lips of clay parted , and he said , with an automatic and lifeless distinctness -- " You damnable hypocrite !" Syme looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale blue ones , and said with dignity -- " Comrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy . He knows as well as I do that I am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty . I do not mince words . I do not pretend to . I say that Comrade Gregory is unfit to be Thursday for all his amiable qualities . He is unfit to be Thursday because of his amiable qualities . We do not want the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy ( hear , hear ). This is no time for ceremonial politeness , neither is it a time for ceremonial modesty . I set myself against Comrade Gregory as I would set myself against all the Governments of Europe , because the	l
of applause . The faces , that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his tirade grew more and more uncompromising , were now distorted with grins of anticipation or cloven with delighted cries . At the moment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of Thursday , a roar of excitement and assent broke forth , and became uncontrollable , and at the same moment Gregory sprang to his feet , with foam upon his mouth , and shouted against the shouting . " Stop , you blasted madmen !" he cried , at the top of a voice that tore his throat . " Stop , you --" But louder than Gregory ' s shouting and louder than the roar of the room came the voice of Syme , still speaking in a peal of pitiless thunder -- " I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers ; I go to earn it ( loud and prolonged cheering ). To the priest who says these men are the enemies of religion , to the judge who says these men are the enemies of law , to	l
with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room , " but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like . No , I will not call it a counsel , for I can give you no reason for it . I will call it a command . Call it a mad command , but act upon it . Strike , but hear me ! Kill me , but obey me ! Do not elect this man ." Truth is so terrible , even in fetters , that for a moment Syme ' s slender and insane victory swayed like a reed . But you could not have guessed it from Syme ' s bleak blue eyes . He merely began -- " Comrade Gregory commands --" Then the spell was snapped , and one anarchist called out to Gregory -- " Who are you ? You are not Sunday "; and another anarchist added in a heavier voice , " And you are not Thursday ." " Comrades ," cried Gregory , in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain , "	l
it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave . If you will not take my command , accept my degradation . I kneel to you . I throw myself at your feet . I implore you . Do not elect this man ." " Comrade Gregory ," said the chairman after a painful pause , " this is really not quite dignified ." For the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a real silence . Then Gregory fell back in his seat , a pale	s
said Syme with gravity . " It was you that entrapped me ," began Gregory , shaking from head to foot , " entrapped me into --" " Talk sense ," said Syme shortly . " Into what sort of devils ' parliament have you entrapped me , if it comes to that ? You made me swear before I made you . Perhaps we are both doing what we think right . But what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession . There is nothing possible between	s
of an army is the anger of a nation ." " Good God , the Board Schools !" said Syme . " Is this undenominational education ?" " No ," said the policeman sadly , " I never had any of those advantages . The Board Schools came after my time . What education I had was very rough and old - fashioned , I am afraid ." " Where did you have it ?" asked Syme , wondering . " Oh , at Harrow ," said the policeman The class sympathies which , false as they are , are the truest things in so many men , broke out of Syme before he could control them . " But , good Lord , man ," he said , " you oughtn ' t to be a policeman !" The policeman sighed and shook his head . " I know ," he said solemnly , " I know I am not worthy ." " But why did you join the police ?" asked Syme with rude curiosity . " For much the same reason that you abused the police ," replied the other . " I found that there was	l
not confuse it ," replied the constable , " with those chance dynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland , which are really the outbreaks of oppressed , if mistaken , men . This is a vast philosophic movement , consisting of an outer and an inner ring . You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood . I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section , the inner ring the supremely guilty section . The outer ring -- the main mass of their supporters -- are merely anarchists ; that	s
is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness . They believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime . They do not believe that the crime creates the punishment . They believe that the punishment has created the crime . They believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring . They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good . These I call the innocent section ." " Oh !" said Syme . " Naturally , therefore , these people talk about ' a happy time coming '; ' the paradise of the future '; ' mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue ,' and so on . And so also the men of the inner circle speak -- the sacred priesthood . They also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future , and of mankind freed at last . But in their mouths "-- and the policeman lowered his voice --" in their mouths these happy	l
, " The Last Crusade ," and a number , the sign of his official authority . He put this carefully in his upper waistcoat pocket , lit a cigarette , and went forth to track and fight the enemy in all the drawing - rooms of London . Where his adventure ultimately led him we have already seen . At about half - past one on a February night he found himself steaming in a small tug up the silent Thames , armed with swordstick and revolver , the duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists . When Syme stepped out on to the steam - tug he had a singular sensation of stepping out into something entirely new ; not merely into the landscape of a new land , but even into the landscape of a new planet . This was mainly due to the insane yet solid decision of that evening , though partly also to an entire change in the weather and the sky since he entered the little tavern some two hours before . Every trace of the passionate plumage of the cloudy sunset had been swept away , and a naked moon	l
the Thames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon . But even the moon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon . The tug was worked by two men , and with much toil went comparatively slowly . The clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had gone down by the time that they passed Battersea , and when they came under the enormous bulk of Westminster day had already begun to break . It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead , showing bars of silver ; and these had brightened	s
figure he was quite conventional , clad in a silk hat and frock - coat of the more formal type of fashion ; he had a red flower in his buttonhole . As Syme drew nearer to him step by step , he did not even move a hair ; and Syme could come close enough to notice even in the dim , pale morning light that his face was long , pale and intellectual , and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin , all else being clean - shaven	s
part of the perspective , was the back of a great mountain of a man . When Syme had seen him , his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone . His vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite incredibly fat . This man was planned enormously in his original proportions , like a statue carved deliberately as colossal . His head , crowned with white hair , as seen from behind looked bigger than a head ought to be . The ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears . He was enlarged terribly to scale ; and this sense of size was so staggering , that when Syme saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish . They were still sitting there as before with their flowers and frock - coats , but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining five children to tea . As Syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel , a waiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head .	l
" The gentlemen are up there , sare ," he said . " They do talk and they do laugh at what they talk . They do say they will throw bombs at ze king ." And the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm , much pleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs . The two men mounted the stairs in silence . Syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe . He knew it	s
. By an effort , braver than that of leaping over a cliff , he went to an empty seat at the breakfast - table and sat down . The men greeted him with good - humoured raillery as if they had always known him . He sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid , shining coffee - pot ; then he looked again at Sunday . His face was very large , but it was still possible to humanity . In the presence of the President the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace ; nothing	s
. " Right , my boy , right ," said the President with a ponderous heartiness , " you aren ' t good at anything ." While this stream of conversation continued , Syme was looking more steadily at the men around him . As he did so , he gradually felt all his sense of something spiritually queer return . He had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume , with the evident exception of the hairy Gogol . But as he looked at the others , he began to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river , a demoniac detail somewhere . That lop - sided laugh , which would suddenly disfigure the fine face of his original guide , was typical of all these types . Each man had something about him , perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth glance , which was not normal , and which seemed hardly human . The only metaphor he could think of was this , that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look , with the additional twist given in a	l
his dark eyes denied this . It was no physical ill that troubled him . His eyes were alive with intellectual torture , as if pure thought was pain . He was typical of each of the tribe ; each man was subtly and differently wrong . Next to him sat Tuesday , the tousle - headed Gogol , a man more obviously mad . Next was Wednesday , a certain Marquis de St . Eustache , a sufficiently characteristic figure . The first few glances found nothing unusual about him , except that he was the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as if they were really his own . He had a black French beard cut square and a black English frock - coat cut even squarer . But Syme , sensitive to such things , felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him , a rich atmosphere that suffocated . It reminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in the darker poems of Byron and Poe . With this went a sense of his being clad , not in lighter colours , but in softer materials ; his	l
of all those wicked men . Syme even had the thought that his eyes might be covered up because they were too frightful to see . CHAPTER VI THE EXPOSURE SUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world . Again and again Syme strove to pull together his common sense in their presence . Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective , that he was only looking at ordinary men , one of whom was old , another nervous , another short - sighted . The sense of an unnatural symbolism always	s
at the bright railings and the sunlit trees . Then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days . In the presence of these powerful and repulsive men , who were the princes of anarchy , he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet Gregory , the mere aesthete of anarchism . He even thought of him now with an old kindness , as if they had played together when children . But he remembered that he was still tied to Gregory by a great promise . He had promised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of doing . He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that policeman . He took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade . His soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision . He had only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous society , and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square beneath him . He had , on the other hand , only to keep his	l
a weak worship of intellect and force , might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality . They might have called Sunday the super - man . If any such creature be conceivable , he looked , indeed , somewhat like it , with his earth - shaking abstraction , as of a stone statue walking . He might have been called something above man , with his large plans , which were too obvious to be detected , with his large face , which was too frank to be understood . But this was	s
perfect nonchalance . Yet the astonished Syme was able to realise that this ease was suddenly assumed ; for there was a slight stumble outside the door , which showed that the departing detective had not minded the step . " Time is flying ," said the President in his gayest manner , after glancing at his watch , which like everything about him seemed bigger than it ought to be . " I must go off at once ; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting ." The Secretary turned to him with working eyebrows . " Would it not be better ," he said a little sharply , " to discuss further the details of our project , now that the spy has left us ?" " No , I think not ," said the President with a yawn like an unobtrusive earthquake . " Leave it as it is . Let Saturday settle it . I must be off . Breakfast here next Sunday ." But the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves of the Secretary . He was one of those men who are conscientious even in crime .	l
" I must protest , President , that the thing is irregular ," he said . " It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council . Of course , I fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor --" " Secretary ," said the President seriously , " if you ' d take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be useful . I can ' t say . But it might . The Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger	s
doll in dirty evening dress . That any human being should stand in such weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient wonder to Syme ; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal shock ; for he realised that the man standing there was the paralytic old Professor de Worms . It scarcely seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities . Syme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood ; but even he could not believe that the Professor had fallen in love with that particular	s
which was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners . He remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists . He shuddered , remembering the real thing . But even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape . The wine , the common food , the familiar place , the faces of natural and talkative men , made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven Days had been a bad dream ; and although he knew it was nevertheless an objective reality ,	s
of silver bees . Getting into his eyes and beard , they added their unremitting futility to his already irritated nerves ; and by the time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet Street , he lost patience , and finding a Sunday teashop , turned into it to take shelter . He ordered another cup of black coffee as an excuse . Scarcely had he done so , when Professor de Worms hobbled heavily into the shop , sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk . Syme ' s walking - stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang , which confessed the concealed steel . But the Professor did not look round . Syme , who was commonly a cool character , was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick . He had seen no cab following ; he had heard no wheels outside the shop ; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot . But the old man could only walk like a snail , and Syme had walked like the wind . He started up and snatched his stick	l
in perfect silver the great orb and the cross . When Syme saw it he suddenly straightened himself , and made with his sword - stick an involuntary salute . He knew that that evil figure , his shadow , was creeping quickly or slowly behind him , and he did not care . It seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright . The devils might have captured heaven , but they had not yet captured the cross . He had a new impulse to	s
and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident . Syme was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision . He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man ' s hat off , called out something like " Catch me if you can ," and went racing away across the white , open Circus . Concealment was impossible now ; and looking back over his shoulder , he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long , swinging	s
strides like a man winning a mile race . But the head upon that bounding body was still pale , grave and professional , like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a harlequin . This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus , up Ludgate Hill , round St . Paul ' s Cathedral , along Cheapside , Syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known . Then Syme broke away towards the river , and ended almost down by the docks . He saw the yellow panes of a low , lighted public - house , flung himself into it and ordered beer . It was a foul tavern , sprinkled with foreign sailors , a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn . A moment later Professor de Worms entered the place , sat down carefully , and asked for a glass of milk . CHAPTER VIII THE PROFESSOR EXPLAINS WHEN Gabriel Syme found himself finally established in a chair , and opposite to him , fixed and final also , the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of the Professor , his fears fully returned . This incomprehensible man from the fierce council	l
, and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric . You think that it is possible to pull down the President . I know that it is impossible , and I am going to try it ," and opening the tavern door , which let in a blast of bitter air , they went out together into the dark streets by the docks . Most of the snow was melted or trampled to mud , but here and there a clot of it still showed grey rather than white in the gloom . The small	s
friends , and have no need at all to disguise myself , I still can ' t help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead -- just as if it were my forehead . I can be quite happy , you understand , but only in a paralytic sort of way . The most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart , but they come out of my mouth quite different . You should hear me say , ' Buck up , old cock !' It would bring tears to your eyes ." " It does ," said Syme ; " but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried ." The Professor started a little and looked at him steadily . " You are a very clever fellow ," he said , " it is a pleasure to work with you . Yes , I have rather a heavy cloud in my head . There is a great problem to face ," and he sank his bald brow in his two hands . Then he said in a low voice -- " Can you play the piano ?" " Yes ," said Syme	l
or delusion . Their infinity was more like the empty infinity of arithmetic , something unthinkable , yet necessary to thought . Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars . He was ascending the house of reason , a thing more hideous than unreason itself . By the time they reached Dr . Bull ' s landing , a last window showed them a harsh , white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red , more like red clay than red cloud . And when they entered Dr . Bull ' s bare garret it was full of light . Syme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty rooms and that austere daybreak . The moment he saw the garret and Dr . Bull sitting writing at a table , he remembered what the memory was -- the French Revolution . There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning . Dr . Bull was in his white shirt and black breeches only ; his cropped , dark head might well have	l
a moment ' s delay ." Dr . Bull smiled again , but continued to gaze on them without speaking . The Professor resumed , a pause before each weary word -- " Please do not think me excessively abrupt ; but I advise you to alter those plans , or if it is too late for that , to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him . Comrade Syme and I have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford , if we are to act on	s
feet , stepping backwards a little , like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion . His eyes were like stars , and for an instant he could only point without speaking . The Professor had also started to his feet , forgetful of his supposed paralysis . He leant on the back of the chair and stared doubtfully at Dr . Bull , as if the Doctor had been turned into a toad before his eyes . And indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene . The two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a	s
s an anarchist ?" " Syme !" cried the other in an apprehensive agony . " Why , by God ," said Syme , " I ' ll take the risk of that myself ! Dr . Bull , I am a police officer . There ' s my card ," and he flung down the blue card upon the table . The Professor still feared that all was lost ; but he was loyal . He pulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend ' s . Then the third man burst out laughing ,	s
. They said that if I had been a criminal , I might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man ; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest man , there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal . But as last I was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force , and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders . And there the others all talked hopelessly . One asked whether a bushy	s
the goggles would go with my hair and socks -- by God , he never saw me at all !" Syme ' s eyes suddenly flashed on him . " How was that ?" he asked . " I thought you talked to him ." " So I did ," said Bull brightly ; " but we talked in a pitch - dark room like a coalcellar . There , you would never have guessed that ." " I could not have conceived it ," said Syme gravely . " It is indeed a new idea ," said the Professor	s
Bull fell for the first time . He reflected a little , and then said -- " Theoretically , I suppose , we ought to call the police ." " Not I ," said Syme . " Theoretically I ought to drown myself first . I promised a poor fellow , who was a real modern pessimist , on my word of honour not to tell the police . I ' m no hand at casuistry , but I can ' t break my word to a modern pessimist . It ' s like breaking one ' s word to a child ." " I ' m in the same boat ," said the Professor . " I tried to tell the police and I couldn ' t , because of some silly oath I took . You see , when I was an actor I was a sort of all - round beast . Perjury or treason is the only crime I haven ' t committed . If I did that I shouldn ' t know the difference between right and wrong ." " I ' ve been through all that ," said Dr . Bull , " and	l
in the best society ." " What the devil are you talking about ?" asked the Professor . " The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century ," said Syme ; " but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce at Bannockburn . Since 1350 the tree is quite clear ." " He ' s gone off his head ," said the little Doctor , staring . " Our bearings ," continued Syme calmly , " are ' argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field .' The motto varies ."	s
beaming . " When the Marquis has given the thirty - ninth reply , which runs --" " Has it by any chance occurred to you ," asked the Professor , with a ponderous simplicity , " that the Marquis may not say all the forty - three things you have put down for him ? In that case , I understand , your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced ." Syme struck the table with a radiant face . " Why , how true that is ," he said , " and I never thought of it . Sir , you have an intellect beyond the common . You will make a name ." " Oh , you ' re as drunk as an owl !" said the Doctor . " It only remains ," continued Syme quite unperturbed , " to adopt some other method of breaking the ice ( if I may so express it ) between myself and the man I wish to kill . And since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone ( as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen ), the only thing	l
all the men were in sombre and solemn morning - dress , with hats like black chimney - pots ; the little Doctor especially , with the addition of his black spectacles , looked like an undertaker in a farce . Syme could not help feeling a comic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow , growing wild flowers everywhere . But , indeed , this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black business .	s
nose . Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ? I have to catch a train ." " I protest that this is most irregular ," said Dr . Bull indignantly . " It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent ," said Colonel Ducroix , looking wistfully at his principal . " There is , I think , one case on record ( Captain Bellegarde and the Baron Zumpt ) in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants . But one can	s
hardly call one ' s nose a weapon ." " Will you or will you not pull my nose ?" said the Marquis in exasperation . " Come , come , Mr . Syme ! You wanted to do it , do it ! You can have no conception of how important it is to me . Don ' t be so selfish ! Pull my nose at once , when I ask you !" and he bent slightly forward with a fascinating smile . The Paris train , panting and groaning , had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill . Syme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures -- the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over . Walking in a world he half understood , he took two paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this remarkable nobleman . He pulled it hard , and it came off in his hand . He stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity , with the pasteboard proboscis still between his fingers , looking at it , while the sun and the clouds and	l
with rage . " If I had known ," he spluttered , " that I was acting for a poltroon who pads himself to fight --" " Oh , I know , I know !" said the Marquis , recklessly throwing various parts of himself right and left about the field . " You are making a mistake ; but it can ' t be explained just now . I tell you the train has come into the station !" " Yes ," said Dr . Bull fiercely , " and the train shall go out of the station . It shall go out without you . We know well enough for what devil ' s work --" The mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture . He was a strange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his old face peeled off , and half another face glaring and grinning from underneath . " Will you drive me mad ?" he cried . " The train --" " You shall not go by the train ," said Syme firmly , and grasped his sword . The wild figure turned towards Syme , and seemed to be	l
English constabulary , but the face was terribly pale . " I am Inspector Ratcliffe ," he said , with a sort of haste that verged on harshness . " My name is pretty well known to the police , and I can see well enough that you belong to them . But if there is any doubt about my position , I have a card " and he began to pull a blue card from his pocket . The Professor gave a tired gesture . " Oh , don ' t show it us ," he said wearily ; " we ' ve got enough of them to equip a paper - chase ." The little man named Bull , had , like many men who seem to be of a mere vivacious vulgarity , sudden movements of good taste . Here he certainly saved the situation . In the midst of this staggering transformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and responsibility of a second , and addressed the two seconds of the Marquis . " Gentlemen ," he said , " we all owe you a serious apology ; but I assure you that you	l
, which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin . How hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise , and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer . " The younger second of the Marquis , a short man with a black moustache , bowed politely , and said -- " Of course , I accept the apology ; but you will in your turn forgive me if I decline to follow you further into your difficulties , and permit myself to say good morning ! The sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow - townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual , and , upon the whole , sufficient for one day . Colonel Ducroix , I would in no way influence your actions , but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal , I am now going to walk back to the town ." Colonel Ducroix moved mechanically , but then tugged abruptly at his white moustache and broke out -- " No , by George ! I won	l
' t . If these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that , I ' ll see them through it . I have fought for France , and it is hard if I can ' t fight for civilization ." Dr . Bull took off his hat and waved it , cheering as at a public meeting . " Don ' t make too much noise ," said Inspector Ratcliffe , " Sunday may hear you ." " Sunday !" cried Bull , and dropped his hat . " Yes ," retorted Ratcliffe	s
every trust , he has captured every cable , he has control of every railway line -- especially of that railway line !" and he pointed a shaking finger towards the small wayside station . " The whole movement was controlled by him ; half the world was ready to rise for him . But there were just five people , perhaps , who would have resisted him . . . and the old devil put them on the Supreme Council , to waste their time in watching each other . Idiots that we are , he planned the whole	s
. " As you very truly say , they are on the horizon ; but if he were walking with them . . . by God ! I believe this ground would shake ." After an instant ' s pause the new man called Ratcliffe said with gloomy decision -- " Of course the President isn ' t with them . I wish to Gemini he were . Much more likely the President is riding in triumph through Paris , or sitting on the ruins of St . Paul ' s Cathedral ." " This is absurd !" said Syme . " Something may have happened in our absence ; but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like that . It is quite true ," he added , frowning dubiously at the distant fields that lay towards the little station , " it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way ; but they are not all the army that you make out ." " Oh , they ," said the new detective contemptuously ; " no they are not a very valuable force . But let me tell you frankly that	l
head was lit as with a light of Rembrandt , leaving all else obliterated ; now again he had strong and staring white hands with the face of a negro . The ex - Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes , and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half - masks of their pursuers . The fancy tinted Syme ' s overwhelming sense of wonder . Was he wearing a mask ? Was anyone wearing a mask ? Was	s
. That ' s Sunday . He is perhaps five hundred miles off , but the fear of him is on all of them , like the finger of God . Yes , they are walking regularly ; and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly , yes , and thinking regularly . But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly ." Syme nodded . It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse . The level of the sunlit	s
earth seemed equally still . Then all their ears , in an agony of attention , heard along the road that indescribable thrill and throb that means only one thing -- horses ! The Colonel ' s face had an instantaneous change , as if lightning had struck it , and yet left it scatheless . " They have done us ," he said , with brief military irony . " Prepare to receive cavalry !" " Where can they have got the horses ?" asked Syme , as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter . The Colonel	s
was silent for a little , then he said in a strained voice -- " I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the ' Soleil d ' Or ' was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles ." " No !" said Syme violently , " I don ' t believe he ' d do it . Not with all that white hair ." " He may have been forced ," said the Colonel gently . " They must be at least a hundred strong , for which reason we are all going to see my friend Renard , who has a motor - car ." With these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street corner , and went down the street with such thundering speed , that the others , though already well at the gallop , had difficulty in following the flying tail of his horse . Dr . Renard inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a steep street , so that when the riders alighted at his door they could once more see the solid green ridge of the hill , with the white	l
down the car as their plans became doubtful , and he brought it finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street that ran down very steeply to the sea . The town was mostly in shadow , but the sun had not sunk ; wherever its level light could break through , it painted everything a burning gold . Up this side street the last sunset light shone as sharp and narrow as the shaft of artificial light at the theatre . It struck the car of the five friends , and lit it like a	s
, hesitated , and the Colonel came face to face with him with frantic gestures of remonstrance . " It is no good ," said Syme . " He will never get anything out of that old heathen . I vote we drive bang through the thick of them , bang as the bullets went through Bull ' s hat . We may all be killed , but we must kill a tidy number of them ." " I won ' t ' ave it ," said Dr . Bull , growing more vulgar in the sincerity of his virtue	s
his left hand and the lantern in his right , and leapt off the high parade on to the beach below . The others leapt after him , with a common acceptance of such decisive action , leaving the debris and the gathering mob above them . " We have one more chance ," said Syme , taking the steel out of his mouth . " Whatever all this pandemonium means , I suppose the police station will help us . We can ' t get there , for they hold the way . But there ' s a pier	s
saw the peasant who had driven their cart . He splashed into the surf on a huge cart - horse , and shook his axe at them . " The peasant !" cried Syme . " They have not risen since the Middle Ages ." " Even if the police do come now ," said the Professor mournfully , " they can do nothing with this mob ." " Nonsence !" said Bull desperately ; " there must be some people left in the town who are human ." " No ," said the hopeless Inspector , " the human being will soon be extinct . We are the last of mankind ." " It may be ," said the Professor absently . Then he added in his dreamy voice , " What is all that at the end of the ' Dunciad '? ' Nor public flame ; nor private , dares to shine ; Nor human light is left , nor glimpse divine ! Lo ! thy dread Empire , Chaos , is restored ; Light dies before thine uncreating word : Thy hand , great Anarch , lets the curtain fall ; And universal darkness buries all	l
The poor old Colonel might have had some cause to complain , having been first forced to fight for two factions that didn ' t exist , and then knocked down with an iron lantern . But he was a magnanimous old gentleman , and being much relieved that neither party had anything to do with dynamite , he saw them off on the pier with great geniality . The five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to each other . The Secretary had to tell Syme how they had come to wear masks originally in order to	s
but I ' m not . Look at my face ." " I dare say it ' s the sort of face that grows on one ," said the President , " in fact , it grows on you ; and who am I to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life ? I dare say it will grow on me some day ." " We have no time for tomfoolery ," said the Secretary , breaking in savagely . " We have come to know what all this means . Who are you ? What are	s
the horse and the driver trying desperately to stop it . The other three cabs came after it ( if the phrase be permissible of a cab ) like panting hounds . Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows . At the highest ecstacy of speed , Sunday turned round on the splashboard where he stood , and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab , with white hair whistling in the wind , he made a horrible face at his pursuers , like some colossal urchin . Then raising his right hand swiftly , he flung	s
Well ," said Syme , " if he ' s that particular kind of old gentleman , if you ' re quite sure that he ' s a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes , you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him . He has run away with the elephant . The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement . And , by thunder , there he is !" There was no doubt about it this	s
time . Clean across the space of grass , about two hundred yards away , with a crowd screaming and scampering vainly at his heels , went a huge grey elephant at an awful stride , with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship ' s bowsprit , and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom . On the back of the bellowing and plunging animal sat President Sunday with all the placidity of a sultan , but goading the animal to a furious speed with some sharp object in his hand . " Stop him !" screamed the populace . " He ' ll be out of the gate !" " Stop a landslide !" said the keeper . " He is out of the gate !" And even as he spoke , a final crash and roar of terror announced that the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the Zoological Gardens , and was careening down Albany Street like a new and swift sort of omnibus . " Great Lord !" cried Bull , " I never knew an elephant could go so fast . Well , it must be hansom - cabs	l
again if we are to keep him in sight ." As they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished , Syme felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed . Afterwards he thought it queer that he should have seen them so clearly . He remembered especially seeing pelicans , with their preposterous , pendant throats . He wondered why the pelican was the symbol of charity , except it was that it wanted a good deal of charity to admire a pelican . He remembered a hornbill ,	s
piece of folded paper , addressed : " To the Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council ." The Secretary , raging , rent it open , and found written inside it :-- " When the herring runs a mile , Let the Secretary smile ; When the herring tries to fly , Let the Secretary die . Rustic Proverb ." " Why the eternal crikey ," began the Secretary , " did you let the man in ? Do people commonly come to you Exhibition riding on mad elephants ? Do --" " Look !" shouted Syme suddenly . " Look over there !" " Look at what ?" asked the Secretary savagely . " Look at the captive balloon !" said Syme , and pointed in a frenzy . " Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon ?' demanded the Secretary . " What is there queer about a captive balloon ?" " Nothing ," said Syme , " except that it isn ' t captive !' They all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the Exhibition on a string , like a child ' s balloon . A second afterwards	l
His room is neat , his clothes are neat , everything seems in order ; but he ' s absent - minded . Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind . For hours he forgets that you are there . Now absent - mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man . We think of a wicked man as vigilant . We can ' t think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy , because we daren ' t think of a wicked man alone with himself . An absentminded man means a	s
don ' t know whether your face , Bull , is a face or a combination in perspective . Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away . Oh , the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump . Sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubts , the doubts of a spiritualist . I am a Buddhist , I suppose ; and Buddhism is not a creed , it is a doubt . My poor dear Bull , I do not believe that you really have a	s
down !" There was no need to cry out to Syme , who had never taken his eyes off it . He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky , right itself , and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun . The man called Gogol , who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels , suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit . " He is dead !" he cried . " And now I know he was my friend -- my friend in the dark !" " Dead !" snorted the Secretary . " You will not find him dead easily . If he has been tipped out of the car , we shall find him rolling as a colt rolls in a field , kicking his legs for fun ." " Clashing his hoofs ," said the Professor . " The colts do , and so did Pan ." " Pan again !" said Dr . Bull irritably . " You seem to think Pan is everything ." " So he is ," said the Professor , " in Greek . He means everything ." " Don '	l
t forget ," said the Secretary , looking down , " that he also means Panic ." Syme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations . " It fell over there ," he said shortly . " Let us follow it !" Then he added with an indescribable gesture -- " Oh , if he has cheated us all by getting killed ! It would be like one of his larks ." He strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy , his rags and ribbons fluttering in the wind . The others followed him in a	s
, a long , low house , mellow in the mild light of sunset . All the six friends compared notes afterwards and quarrelled ; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood . It was either this elm - top or that crooked path , it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window ; but each man of them declared that he could remember this place before he could remember his mother . When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large , low , cavernous gateway , another man in the same uniform , but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat , came out to meet them . This impressive person said to the bewildered Syme -- " Refreshments are provided for you in your room ." Syme , under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement , went up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant . He entered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed specially for him . He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his	l
- blue drapery , rather of the nature of a domino , on the front of which was emblazoned a large golden sun , and which was splashed here and there with flaming stars and crescents . " You ' re to be dressed as Thursday , sir ," said the valet somewhat affably . " Dressed as Thursday !" said Syme in meditation . " It doesn ' t sound a warm costume ." " Oh , yes , sir ," said the other eagerly , " the Thursday costume is quite warm , sir . It fastens up	s
to the chin ." " Well , I don ' t understand anything ," said Syme , sighing . " I have been used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out . Still , I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon . Those orbs , I think , shine on other days . I once saw the moon on Tuesday , I remember ." " Beg pardon , sir ," said the valet , " Bible also provided for you ," and with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage in the first chapter of Genesis . Syme read it wondering . It was that in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the creation of the sun and moon . Here , however , they reckoned from a Christian Sunday . " This is getting wilder and wilder ," said Syme , as he sat down in a chair . " Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and Burgundy , and green clothes and Bibles ? Do they provide	l
gesture , his sword stood out at an angle , and he had all the swagger of a troubadour . For these disguises did not disguise , but reveal . CHAPTER XV THE ACCUSER AS Syme strode along the corridor he saw the Secretary standing at the top of a great flight of stairs . The man had never looked so noble . He was draped in a long robe of starless black , down the centre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white , like a single shaft of light . The whole looked like some very severe ecclesiastical vestment . There was no need for Syme to search his memory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness . The vestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol ; and Syme felt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black expressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary , with his inhuman veracity and his cold frenzy , which made him so easily make war on the anarchists , and yet so easily pass for one of	l
poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes , to split it up into sun and star . The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite ; the poet always loves the finite . For him the great moment is not the creation of light , but the creation of the sun and moon . As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook Ratcliffe , who was clad in spring green like a huntsman , and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees . For he stood for that third day on which the earth and green things were made , and his square , sensible face , with its not unfriendly cynicism , seemed appropriate enough to it . They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old English garden , full of torches and bonfires , by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress . Syme seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated in some crazy costume . There was a man dressed as a windmill with enormous sails , a man dressed as an elephant	l
flung up his face to look at them , that Syme saw , with thunder - struck clearness , that the face was the broad , almost ape - like face of his old friend Gregory , with its rank red hair and its insulting smile . " Gregory !" gasped Syme , half - rising from his seat . " Why , this is the real anarchist !" " Yes ," said Gregory , with a great and dangerous restraint , " I am the real anarchist ." "' Now there was a day ,'" murmured Bull , who	s
last -- you are the people in power ! You are the police -- the great fat , smiling men in blue and buttons ! You are the Law , and you have never been broken . But is there a free soul alive that does not long to break you , only because you have never been broken ? We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government . It is all folly ! The only crime of the Government is that it governs . The unpardonable sin of the	s
that we have never been broken . We have been broken upon the wheel . It is not true that we have never descended from these thrones . We have descended into hell . We were complaining of unforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man entered insolently to accuse us of happiness . I repel the slander ; we have not been happy . I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused . At least --" He had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of Sunday , which wore a strange smile . " Have you ," he cried in a dreadful voice , " have you ever suffered ?" As he gazed , the great face grew to an awful size , grew larger than the colossal mask of Memnon , which had made him scream as a child . It grew larger and larger , filling the whole sky ; then everything went black . Only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his brain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text that he had heard somewhere ,	l
joined their hands all together . As for Peggy and Nancy , it was little that they could do ; but they were good children , and Mary , when she considered that so much depended upon her , was resolved to exert herself to the utmost . Her first care was to pay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her , for which she left money done up carefully in separate papers . When all these were paid away , there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a year '	s
but this he refused . It was now September 25th , and he said that the new tenant must come in on the 29th , so that she must quit it directly . Mary could not bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her brother and sisters in FOR CHARITY ' S SAKE ; for the neighbours were all poor enough themselves . So she bethought herself that she might find shelter in the ruins of the old castle of Rossmore where she and her brother , in better times , had often played at hide and seek . The kitchen and two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well ; and a little thatch , she thought , would make them comfortable through the winter . The agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in there , upon her paying him half a guinea in hand , and promising to pay the same yearly . Into these lodgings the orphans now removed , taking with them two bedsteads , a stool , chair and a table , a sort of press , which contained what little	l
good account of these orphans . She particularly commended Mary ' s honesty , in having immediately paid all her mother ' s debts to the utmost farthing , as far as her money would go . She told the ladies how Mary had been turned out of her house , and how she had offered her goat , of which she was very fond , to discharge a debt due for her schooling ; and , in short , the schoolmistress , who had known Mary for several years , spoke so well of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old castle of Rossmore to see her the next day . When they went there , they found the room in which the children lived as clean and neat as such a ruined place could be made . Edmund was out working with a farmer , Mary was spinning , and her little sisters were measuring out some bogberries , of which they had gathered a basketful , for sale . Isabella , after telling Mary what an excellent character she had heard of her , inquired what it was she most wanted ;	l
come over to Ireland . The rush candles caught his attention ; for he had never seen any of them before , as he came from a part of England where they were not used . Edmund , who was ready to oblige , and proud that his candles were noticed showed the Englishman how they were made , and gave him a bundle of rushes .* [*" The proper species of rush ," says White , in his ' Natural History of Selborne ,' " seems to be the Juncus effusus , or common soft rush , which is	s
a pound of rushes , medicated and ready for use , will cost three shillings ."] The servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance , and remembered it long after it was forgotten by Edmund . Whenever his master wanted to send a messenger anywhere , Gilbert ( for that was the servant ' s name ) always employed his little friend Edmund , whom , upon further acquaintance , he liked better and better . He found that Edmund was both quick and exact in executing commissions . One day , after he had waited	s
plain work , and Edmund by leading of cart - horses , going on errands , etc ., and with little Peggy and Anne ' s earnings , the family contrived to live comfortably . Isabella and Caroline often visited them , and sometimes gave them clothes , and sometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting ; and these children did not EXPECT , that because the ladies did something for them , they should do everything . They did not grow idle or wasteful . When Edmund was about twelve years old , his friend Gilbert sent	s
young ladies , as soon as they had collected the money , walked to the old castle , where they found everything neat and clean as usual . They had great pleasure in giving to this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity , which she received with some surprise and more gratitude . They advised her to continue the shoemaking trade , as they found the shoes were liked , and they knew that they could have a sale for them at the Repository in Dublin . Mary , encouraged by these kind friends , went on with her little manufacture with increased activity . Peggy and Anne platted the packthread , and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her . Edmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning , provided he was back again before eight o ' clock . It was summer time , and he got up early , because he liked to go home to see his sisters , and he took his share in the manufactory . It was his business to hammer the soles flat : and as soon as he came home every morning he performed his	l
their work , all sitting round the meal chest , which served them for a table . " My hands must be washed ," said George , a little boy who came running in ; " I ran so fast that I might be in time , to go to work along with you all , that I tumbled down , and look how I have dirtied my hands . Most haste worst speed . My hands must be washed before I can do anything ." Whilst George was washing his hands , two other little children , who had	s
England ; it was slated , and neatly fitted up inside ; but the rent of it was six guineas a year , and this was far above what Mary could afford to pay . Three guineas a year she thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage . Besides , she heard that several proposals had been made to Mr . Harvey for this house , and she knew that Mr . Hopkins , the agent , was not her friend ; therefore she despaired of getting it . There was no other to be	s
him upon the great table in his hall , and we all standing by ! I remember it as well as if it was this instant ." " And so do I ," cried Anne . " And don ' t you recollect , Mary , your picking out the gold ones , and telling Mr . Hopkins that they were gold ; and he said you knew nothing of the matter ; and I was going to tell him that Miss Isabella had tried them , and knew that they were gold ? but just then there came in some tenants to pay their rent , and he pushed us out , and twitched from my hand the piece of gold which I had taken up to show him the bright spot which Miss Isabella had cleaned by the stuff that she had poured on it ? I believe he was afraid I should steal it ; he twitched it from my hand in such a hurry . Do , Edmund ; do , Mary -- let us go to him , and put him in mind of all this ." " I ' ll go to him no	l
as she could ; and though she struggled against it , she felt very melancholy . Still she exerted herself every day at her little manufacture ; and she endeavoured to console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not give up her character , and who continued steadily to protect her and her sisters . Isabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity of the orphans , but to prove it was in this instance out of their power . Mr . Hopkins , the agent , and his friends , constantly repeated that the gold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his ; and these ladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those that were , with great reason , suspected to be thieves . The orphans were in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on , and their benefactresses left the country to spend some months in Dublin . The old castle , it was true , was likely to last through the winter , as the mason said ; but though the want of a comfortable house to live in	l
father and mother to see the magnificent library of a nobleman , who took generous and polite pleasure in thus sharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any pretensions to science or literature . Knowing that the gentleman who was now come to see his library was skilled in antiquities , the nobleman opened a drawer of medals , to ask his opinion concerning the age of some coins , which he had lately purchased at a high price . They were the very same which the orphans had found at Rossmore Castle . Isabella and Caroline knew them again instantly ; and as the cross which Isabella had made on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass , there could be no possibility of doubt . The nobleman , who was much interested both by the story of these orphans , and the manner in which it was told to him , sent immediately for the person from whom he had purchased the coins . He was a Jew broker . At first he refused to tell them from whom he got them , because he had bought them , he	l
said , under a promise of secrecy . Being further pressed , he acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he should not sell them to anyone in Ireland , but that he had been tempted by the high price the present noble possessor had offered . At last , when the Jew was informed that the coins were stolen , and that he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods , if he did not confess the whole truth , he declared that he had purchased them from a gentleman , whom	s
. This house was given to them ' AS A REWARD FOR THEIR HONESTY .'" LAZY LAWRENCE . In the pleasant valley of Ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name of Preston . She had a small neat cottage , and there was not a weed to be seen in her garden . It was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for support ; it consisted of strawberry beds , and one small border for flowers . The pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays , and sent either to Clifton or Bristol to be sold . As to her strawberries , she did not send them to market , because it was the custom for numbers of people to come from Clifton , in the summer time , to eat strawberries and cream at the gardens in Ashton . Now , the widow Preston was so obliging , active and good - humoured , that everyone who came to see her was pleased . She lived happily in this manner for several years ; but , alas ! one autumn she fell sick , and , during her illness , everything went wrong ;	l
Jem ; and after he had looked a little longer , he found the piece of crystal . " Thank ' e ," said the man , " you are a fine little industrious fellow ." Jem , encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this , ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman . " One good turn deserves another ," said the man ; " we are going to dinner just now , and shall leave off work -- wait for me here , and I ' ll make it worth your while ." Jem waited ; and , as he was very attentively observing how the workmen went on with their work , he heard somebody near him give a great yawn , and , turning round , he saw stretched upon the grass , beside the river , a boy about his own age , who , in the village of Ashton , as he knew , went by the name of Lazy Lawrence -- a name which he most justly deserved , for he never did anything from morning to night . He neither	l
The fruit woman ' s stall was at the gate of an inn yard ; and peeping through the gate in this yard , Lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy , about his own size , playing at pitch farthing . He stood by watching them for a few minutes . " I began but with one halfpenny ," cried the stable boy , with an oath , " and now I ' ve got twopence !" added he , jingling the halfpence in his waistcoat pocket . Lawrence was moved at the sound , and said to	s
shocked him ; for Lawrence , though lazy , had not yet learned to be a wicked boy . But , by degrees , he was accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling , and took a delight and interest in their disputes and battles . As this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion , he soon grew so fond of it , that every day he returned to the stable yard , and the horse block became his constant seat . Here he found some relief from the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing , and here , hour after hour , with his elbows on his knees , and his head on his hands , he sat , the spectator of wickedness . Gaming , cheating and lying soon became familiar to him ; and , to complete his ruin , he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stable boy ( a very bad boy ) with whom he had first begun to game . The consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see . But it is now time to inquire what little Jem had been doing all this while .	l
house , on the common which Jem rode over when he went to Farmer Truck ' s for the giant strawberries , he remembered to have seen a great quantity of this heath ; and , as it was now only six o ' clock in the evening , he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot , stroke him , go to the common , return , and make one trial of his skill before he went to bed . Lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common , and there Jem gathered as much of the heath as he thought he should want . But what toil ! what time ! what pains did it cost him , before he could make anything like a mat ! Twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath , and give up his project , from impatience of repeated disappointments . But still he persevered . Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and time . Two hours he worked before he went to bed . All his play hours the next day he spent at his mat ; which , in all , made five hours	l
search the garden myself ." He now went home , but felt it a great restraint to wait till to - morrow evening before he told his mother . To console himself he flew to the stable :--" Lightfoot , you ' re not to be sold on Monday , poor fellow !" said he , patting him , and then could not refrain from counting out his money . Whilst he was intent upon this , Jem was startled by a noise at the door : somebody was trying to pull up the latch . It opened , and there came in Lazy Lawrence , with a boy in a red jacket , who had a cock under his arm . They started when they got into the middle of the stable , and when they saw Jem , who had been at first hidden by the horse . " We -- we -- we came ," stammered Lazy Lawrence --" I mean , I came to -- to -- to --" " To ask you ," continued the stable - boy , in a bold tone , " whether you will go with us to the cock -	l
the room playfully . " Now , keep those spirits of yours , Jem , till you want ' em , and don ' t let it come upon you all at once . Have it in mind that to - morrow ' s fair day , and Lightfoot must go . I bid Farmer Truck call for him to - night . He said he ' d take him along with his own , and he ' ll be here just now -- and then I know how it will be with you , Jem !" " So do I !" cried Jem , swallowing his secret with great difficulty , and then tumbling head over heels four times running . A carriage passed the window , and stopped at the door . Jem ran out ; it was his mistress . She came in smiling , and soon made the old woman smile , too , by praising the neatness of everything in the house . We shall pass over , however important as they were deemed at the time , the praises of the strawberries , and of " my grandmother ' s china plate ." Another	l
knock was heard at the door . " Run , Jem ," said his mother . " I hope it ' s our milk - woman with cream for the lady ." No ; it was Farmer Truck come for Lightfoot . The old woman ' s countenance fell . " Fetch him out , dear ," said she , turning to her son ; but Jem was gone ; he flew out to the stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck ' s great - coat . " Sit ye down , farmer ," said the	s
open ( for it was tied with a pretty stout cord ) one of ' em whips out with his knife and cuts it -- Now , have you a knife about you , sir ?" continued the milk woman to the farmer . He gave her his knife . " Here , now , ma ' am , just sticking , as it were here , between the blade and the haft , was the silver penny . The lad took no notice ; but when he opened it , out it falls . Still he takes no heed	s
take his horse and ride after them . " Ay ," added Farmer Truck , " do you take the road , and I ' ll take the field way , and I ' ll be bound we ' ll have ' em presently ." Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves , the lady , who was now thoroughly convinced of Jem ' s truth , desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening . Out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle	s
forcing through all resistance , he staggered up to the footman just as he was lifting down the boy he had carried before him . " I WILL -- I tell you I WILL see the thief !" cried the drunken man , pushing up the boy ' s hat . It was his own son . " Lawrence !" exclaimed the wretched father . The shock sobered him at once , and he hid his face in his hands . There was an awful silence . Lawrence fell on his knees , and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the circumstances of his guilt . " Such a young creature so wicked !" the bystanders exclaimed ; " what could put such wickedness in your head ?" " Bad company ," said Lawrence . " And how came you -- what brought you into bad company ?" " I don ' t know , except it was idleness ." While this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence ' s pockets ; and when the money appeared , all his former companions in the village looked at each other with	l
astonishment and terror . Their parents grasped their little hands closer , and cried , " Thank God ! he is not my son . How often when he was little we used , as he lounged about , to tell him that idleness was the root of all evil ." As for the hardened wretch , his accomplice , everyone was impatient to have him sent to gaol . He put on a bold , insolent countenance , till he heard Lawrence ' s confession ; till the money was found upon him ; and he heard the milk	s
it ' s better he should go to Bridewell now , than to the gallows by - and - by ." Nothing more was said ; for everybody felt the truth of the farmer ' s speech . Lawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month , and the stable - boy was sent for trial , convicted , and transported to Botany Bay . During Lawrence ' s confinement , Jem often visited him , and carried him such little presents as he could afford to give ; and Jem could afford to be GENEROUS , because he	s
behaving well he would certainly , sooner or later , secure the esteem and love of all who knew him , even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his father ' s account . This hope was very delightful to Franklin , and he showed the strongest desire to learn and to do everything that was right ; so that Mr . Spencer soon grew fond of him , and took great pains to instruct him , and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful , respectable and	s
you , sir ." " And you will always -- I mean , as long as you deserve it -- find a friend in me ." " Thank you , sir -- I am sure you are --" There Franklin stopped short , for the recollection of all Mr . Spencer ' s goodness rushed upon him at once , and he could not say another word . " Bring me a candle to seal this letter ," said his master ; and he was very glad to get out of the room . He came back with the candle	s
, and , with a stout heart , stood by whilst the letter was sealing ; and , when his master put it into his hand , said , in a cheerful voice , " I hope you will let me see you again , sir , sometimes ." " Certainly ; whenever your mistress can spare you , I shall be very glad to see you ; and remember , if ever you get into any difficulty , don ' t be afraid to come to me . I have sometimes spoken harshly to you ; but you will not meet with a more indulgent friend ." Franklin at this turned away with a full heart ; and , after making two or three attempts to express his gratitude , left the room without being able to speak . He got to Queen ' s Square about three o ' clock . The door was opened by a large , red - faced man , in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat , to whom he felt afraid to give his message , lest he should not be a servant . " Well , what ' s your business	l
. She smothered her displeasure , however , till night ; when , as she attended her mistress ' toilette , she could not refrain from expressing her sentiments . She began cautiously : " Ma ' am , is not this the boy Mr . Spencer was talking of one day -- that has been brought up by the VILLAINTROPIC SOCIETY , I think they call it ?" " Philanthropic Society ; yes ," said her mistress ; " and my brother gives him a high character : I hope he will do very well ." " I '	s
m sure I hope so too ," observed Mrs . Pomfret ; " but I can ' t say ; for my part , I ' ve no great notion of those low people . They say all those children are taken from the very lowest DRUGS and REFUGES of the town , and surely they are like enough , ma ' am , to take after their own fathers and mothers ." " But they are not suffered to be with their parents ," rejoined the lady ; " and therefore cannot be hurt by their example . This little boy , to be sure , was unfortunate in his father , but he has had an excellent education ." " Oh , EDICATION ! to be sure , ma ' am , I know . I don ' t say but what edication is a great thing . But then , ma ' am , edication can ' t change the NATUR that ' s in one , they say ; and one ' s that born naturally bad and low , they say , all the edication in the world won ' t do no good ;	l
shirt , a cravat , a pair of thin shoes , and , above all , shoe strings , besides other nameless advantages , which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen . However , upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr . Spencer had ever said to him , he could not recollect his having warned him that shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant ; so that he could only comfort himself with resolving , if possible , to make amends for these deficiencies , and to dissipate the	s
of adversity had past , the ungrateful cook would forget her benefactor , and , when it came to his supper time , would throw him , with a carelessness that touched him sensibly , anything which the other servants were too nice to eat . All this Franklin bore with fortitude ; nor did he envy Felix the dainties which he ate , sometimes close beside him : " For ," said he to himself , " I have a clear conscience , and that is more than Felix can have . I know how he wins cook ' s favour too well , and I fancy I know how I have offended her ; for since the day I saw the basket , she has done nothing but huff me ." The history of the basket was this . Mrs . Pomfret , the housekeeper , had several times , directly and indirectly , given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late . Now , when she spoke , it was usually at dinner time ; she always looked , or Franklin imagined that	l
, if Felix , with a sneer , had not called them CROCODILE TEARS . " Felix , too !" thought he ; " this is too much ." In fact , Felix had till now professed himself his firm ally , and had on his part received from Franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship ; for it must be told that every other morning , when it was Felix ' s turn to get breakfast , Felix never was up in decent time , and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if Franklin had not got all the breakfast	s
. He knew how to bring his charge home to her . He produced a note in her own handwriting , the purport of which was to request her cousin ' s acceptance of " some DELICATE COLD TURKEY ," and to beg she would send her , by the return of the bearer , a little of her cherry - brandy . Mrs . Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook ' s discharge , and informed Felix she had no further occasion for his services , but , upon his pleading with many tears , which Franklin did not call CROCODILE TEARS , that he was so young , that he was under the dominion of his aunt , he touched Mrs . Pomfret ' s compassion , and she obtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month , to give him yet a chance of redeeming his character . Mrs . Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon , resolved , for the future , to be more upon her guard with Felix , and felt that she had treated Franklin with great injustice , when	l
, as much as anyone would meet with in this world ." For the truth of this assertion he appealed , laughing , to a party of men who were drinking in the room . The men , however , took part with Corkscrew , and , drawing him over to their table , made him sit down with them . They were in high good - humour , and the butler soon grew so intimate with them , that , in the openness of his heart , he soon communicated to them , not only all his own affairs	s
an ample share in the booty . The butler , who had the reputation of being an honest man , and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof against everything but his mistress ' port , turned pale , and trembled at this proposal ; drank two or three bumpers to drown thought ; and promised to give an answer the next day . He went home more than half - intoxicated . His mind was so full of what had passed , that he could not help bragging to Felix , whom he found awake at his return ,	s
poured out . He sighed -- drank -- hesitated -- drank again -- heard the landlord talk of his bill , saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment -- drank again -- cursed himself , and , giving his hand to the villain who was whispering in his ear , swore that he could not help it , and must do as they would have him . They required of him to give up the key of the house door , that they might get another made by it . He had left it with Felix , and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had arisen . Felix knew enough to ruin them , and must therefore be won over . This was no very difficult task ; he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats , and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe . The cravats were bought and shown to Felix . He thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete , fine gentleman ; and to go without them , especially when he had once seen	l
impossible ," retorted she , vehemently , " for I left this candlestick with my own hands last night , in the hall , the last thing I did , after you ," said she , turning to the butler , " was gone to bed -- I ' m sure of it -- Nay , don ' t you recollect my taking this JAPANNED CANDLESTICK out of your hand , and making you to go up to bed with the brass one , and I bolted the door at the stair - head after you ?" This was all	s
I thought , perhaps , you might not particularly remember ; for if you please to recollect --" " I won ' t please to recollect just whatever you please , sir ! Hold your tongue ; why should you poke yourself into this scrape ; what have you to do with it , I should be glad to know ?" " Nothing in the world , oh nothing in the world ; I ' m sure I beg your pardon , ma ' am ," answered Felix , in a soft tone ; and , sneaking off , left	s
, it struck before I came upstairs , and you know we are twenty minutes slow -- Lord bless us !" exclaimed Mrs . Pomfret , as she let fall the bar of the window , which roused her mistress . " I ' m sure I beg your pardon a thousand times -- it ' s only the bar -- because I had this great key in my hand ." " Put down the key , then , or you ' ll knock something else down ; and you may open the shutters now ; for I ' m	s
key in her hand . She spoke to him of his last night ' s exertions in terms of much approbation . " How long have you lived with me ?" said she , pausing ; " three weeks , I think ?" " Three weeks and four days , madam ." " That is but a short time ; yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think I may depend upon you . You know this key ?" " I believe , madam , it is the key of the house - door ." " It	s
his own way . Felix , you would have no objection , I suppose , to going to the play with me ?" " Oh , I should like it of all things , if I did not come between anybody else . But come , come !" added the hypocrite , assuming a tone of friendly persuasion , " you won ' t be such a blockhead , Franklin , as to lose going to the play for nothing ; it ' s only just obstinacy . What harm can it do , to lend Mr . Corkscrew the	s
plan Felix put into execution . They discovered the place where Franklin kept the key at night , stole it whilst he slept , took off the impression in wax , and carefully replaced it in Franklin ' s trunk , exactly where they found it . Probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax . Knowing how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it : and the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant . By means of the impression , which they had thus obtained , Corkscrew and Felix proposed to get a false key made by Picklock , a smith who belonged to their gang of house - breakers ; and with this false key knew they could open the door whenever they pleased . Little suspecting what had happened , Franklin , the next morning went to unlock the house door , as usual ; but finding the key entangled in the lock , he took it out to examine it , and perceived a lump of wax sticking in one of the wards . Struck with this	l
thank God . I was afraid to go to the window this morning ; but it was my luck to see them all go by to gaol . They looked so shocking ! I am sure I never shall forget Felix ' s look to my dying day ! But poor Franklin ! ma ' am ; that boy has the best heart in the world . I could not get him to give a second look at them as they passed . Poor fellow ! I thought he would have dropped ; and he was so modest , ma	s
she had a peculiar dislike ,-- Susan Price , a sweet tempered , modest , sprightly , industrious lass , who was the pride and delight of the village . Her father rented a small farm , and , unfortunately for him , he lived near Attorney Case . Barbara used often to sit at her window , watching Susan at work . Sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds , or weeding the borders ; sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees ; sometimes she was in the poultry	s
Attorney wants to get our playground , so he does . I wish he and his daughter Bab , or Miss Barbara , as she must now be called , were a hundred miles off , out of our way , I know . No later than yesterday she threw down my nine - pins in one of her ill - humours , as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the dust ." " Yes ," cried Mary , the little primrose - girl , " her gown is always trailing . She does not hold it up nicely , like Susan ; and with all her fine clothes she never looks half so neat . Mamma says she wishes I may be like Susan , when I grow up to be a great girl , and so do I . I should not like to look conceited as Barbara does , if I was ever so rich ." " Rich or poor ," said Philip , " it does not become a girl to look conceited , much less BOLD , as Barbara did the other day , when she was at her father '	l
t wait for me ; I can ' t come to you , but ," added she , pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden , " gather those for poor little Mary ; I promised them to her , and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile , on the right as we go to church . Good - bye ! never mind me ; I can ' t come -- I can ' t stay , for my father wants me ." " But don ' t turn away your	s
-- I ' ll tell you what it is ." As he lowered his voice , Susan , who was not sure that he wished she should hear what he was going to say , retired from behind his chair . " Susan , don ' t go ; sit you down here , my sweet Susan ," said he , making room for her upon his chair ; " I believe I was a little cross when I came in first tonight ; but I had something to vex me , as you shall hear . " About a	s
fortnight ago , you know , wife ," continued he , " there was a balloting in our town for the militia ; now at that time I wanted but ten days of forty years of age ; and the attorney told me I was a fool for not calling myself plump forty . But the truth is the truth , and it is what I think fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it . So I was drawn for a militiaman ; but when I thought how loth you and I would be to part , I was main glad to hear that I could get off by paying eight or nine guineas for a substitute -- only I had not the nine guineas -- for , you know , we had bad luck with our sheep this year , and they died away one after another -- but that was no excuse , so I went to Attorney Case , and , with a power of difficulty , I got him to lend me the money ; for which , to be sure , I gave him something , and left my lease	l
he has begun with me badly enough already . I ' m not come to the worst part of my story yet --" Here Farmer Price made a dead stop ; and his wife and Susan looked up in his face , breathless with anxiety . " It must come out ," said he , with a short sigh ; " I must leave you in three days , wife ." " Must you ?" said his wife , in a faint , resigned voice . " Susan , love , open the window ." Susan ran to open the window , and then returned to support her mother ' s head . When she came a little to herself she sat up , begged that her husband would go on , and that nothing might be concealed from her . Her husband had no wish indeed to conceal anything from a wife he loved so well ; but , firm as he was , and steady to his maxim , that the truth was the thing the fittest to be spoken at all times , his voice faltered , and it was with great difficulty that he brought himself	l
court , in hopes of obtaining his favour . Of the agency he flattered himself that he was pretty secure ; and he thought that he might assume the tone of command towards the tenants , especially towards one who was some guineas in debt , and in whose lease there was a flaw . Accosting the farmer in a haughty manner , the attorney began with , " So , Farmer Price , a word with you , if you please . Walk on here , man , beside my horse , and you ' ll hear me . You have changed your opinion , I hope , about that bit of land -- that corner at the end of my garden ?" " As how , Mr . Case ?" said the farmer . " As how , man ! Why , you said something about its not belonging to me , when you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day ." " So I did ," said Price , " and so I do ." Provoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words were pronounced , the attorney was upon the point	l
of swearing that he would have his revenge ; but , as his passions were habitually attentive to the LETTER of the law , he refrained from any hasty expression , which might , he was aware , in a court of justice , be hereafter brought against him . " My good friend , Mr . Price ," said he , in a soft voice , and pale with suppressed rage . He forced a smile . " I ' m under the necessity of calling in the money I lent you some time ago , and you will	s
we are determined to have Susan ' s favourite hen ; so , if one shilling won ' t do , take two ; and if two won ' t do , why , take three ." The shillings sounded provoking upon the table , as she threw them down one after another , and Barbara coolly replied , " Three won ' t do ." " Have you no conscience , Miss Barbara ? Then take four ." Barbara shook her head . A fifth shilling was instantly proffered ; but Bab , who now saw plainly that she	s
the questions that were asked her , pleased the ladies at the Abbey , who were good judges of character and manners . Sir Arthur Somers had two sisters , sensible , benevolent women . They were not of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to THE COUNTRY ; nor yet were they of that bustling sort , who quack and direct all their poor neighbours , for the mere love of managing , or the want of something to do . They were judiciously generous ; and whilst they wished to diffuse happiness	s
maybe , when she has settled the grand matter of the broth . I ' ll step in and ask to see her mother , that will put her in a good humour in a trice ." Barbara followed Susan into the cottage , and found her occupied with the grand affair of the broth . " Is it ready ?" said Bab , peeping into the pot that was over the fire . " Dear , how savoury it smells ! I ' ll wait till you go in with it to your mother ; for I must ask her how she does myself ." " Will you please to sit down then , miss ," said Simple Susan , with a smile ; for at this instant she forgot the guinea - hen ; " I have but just put the parsley into the broth ; but it soon will be ready ." During this interval Bab employed herself , much to her own satisfaction , in cross - questioning Susan . She was rather provoked indeed that she could not learn exactly how each of the ladies was dressed , and what there was to be for	l
you ? People , you know , don ' t always mean exactly , downright , neither more nor less than what they say ." " Not always ," said Susan , with an arch smile , which convinced Barbara that she was not quite a simpleton . " NOT ALWAYS ," repeated Barbara colouring ,--" oh , then I suppose you have some guess at what Miss Somers meant ." " No ," said Susan , " I was not thinking about Miss Somers , when I said not always ." " How nice that broth does look ," resumed Barbara , after a pause . Susan had now poured the broth into a basin , and as she strewed over it the bright orange marigolds , it looked very tempting . She tasted it , and added now a little salt , and now a little more , till she thought it was just to her mother ' s taste . " Oh ! _I_ must taste it ," said Bab , taking the basin up greedily . " Won ' t you take a spoon ?" said Susan , trembling at the large mouthfuls which Barbara sucked	l
, like Susan , bear with her father ' s testy humour from affection and gentleness of disposition , but who always humoured him from artifice , tried all her skill to fathom his thoughts , and when she found that it would not do , she went to tell her maid so , and to complain that her father was so cross there was no bearing him . It is true that Attorney Case was not in the happiest mood possible ; for he was by no means satisfied with his morning ' s work at the Abbey .	s
could know all the mazes of the law , and yet prefer the straight road , was incomprehensible . Mr . Case , having paid Sir Arthur some compliments on his great legal abilities , and his high reputation at the bar , he coolly replied , " I have left the bar ." The attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment , that a man who was actually making 3 , OOO pounds per annum at the bar should leave it . " I am come ," said Sir Arthur , " to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the	s
attention . " Now I have him ," said the cunning tempter to himself . " Neither in law nor equity ," repeated Sir Arthur , with apparent incredulity . " Are you sure of that , Mr . Case ?" " Sure ! As I told you before , sir , I ' d pledge my whole credit upon the thing -- I ' d stake my existence ." " THAT ' S SOMETHING ," said Sir Arthur , as if he was pondering upon the matter . The attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man , who sees a chance at one stroke of winning a rich friend , and of ruining a poor enemy . He explained , with legal volubility and technical amplification , the nature of the mistake in Mr . Price ' s lease . " It was , sir ," said he , " a lease for the life of Peter Price , Susanna his wife , and to the survivor or survivors of them , or for the full time and term of twenty years , to be computed from the first day of May then next ensuing	l
I do not love my lamb half so well ." The struggle of her mind ceased , and with a placid countenance and calm voice , " take the lamb ," said she . " Where is it ?" said the attorney . " Grazing in the meadow , by the river side ." " It must be brought up before night - fall for the butcher , remember ." " I shall not forget it ," said Susan , steadily . As soon , however , as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the house , Susan sat down , and hid her face in her hands . She was soon aroused by the sound of her mother ' s feeble voice , who was calling Susan from the inner room where she lay . Susan went in ; but did not undraw the curtain as she stood beside the bed . " Are you there , love ? Undraw the curtain , that I may see you , and tell me ;-- I thought I heard some strange voice just now talking to my child . Something ' s amiss , Susan ," said her mother ,	l
been running upon her poor lamb . She corrected all the mistakes with so much patience , and bore to be blamed with so much good humour , that her father at last said , that it was impossible ever to scold Susan , without being in the wrong at the last . As soon as all was set right , Price took the bills , and said he would go round to the neighbours , and collect the money himself ; for that he should be very proud to have it to say to them , that it was all earned by his own little daughter . Susan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his week ' s reprieve till he should come home to sup , as he had promised to do , in her mother ' s room . She was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the knapsack , which she had been packing up for his journey . " How delighted he will be when he hears the good news !" said she , to herself ; " but I know he will be a little sorry too for	l
who had stationed himself between the old man ' s knees . " Then you heard MY sister Susan speak just now . Can you tell us what sort of person she is ?" " That I can , I think , without being a conjurer ," said the old man , lifting the boy up on his knee ; " YOUR sister Susan is good - natured ." The boy clapped his hands . " And good - tempered ." " RIGHT ," said little William , with a louder clap of applause . " And very fond of	s
saying , " Will you be pleased to remember us ?" The children readily produced their halfpence , and thought their wealth well bestowed upon this poor , good - natured man , who had taken so much pains to entertain them , better even than upon the gingerbread woman , whose stall they loved to frequent . The hat was held some time to the attorney ' s son before he chose to see it . At last he put his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling . There were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat . " I ' ll take these halfpence ," said he , " and here ' s a shilling for you ." " God bless you , sir ," said the lad ; but as he took the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put INTO THE BLIND MAN ' S HAND , he saw that it was not worth one farthing . " I am afraid it is not good , sir ," said the lad , whose business it was to examine the money for his master . " I am afraid , then ,	l
from me , and I shan ' t take it back again , I promise you ." A whisper of " that ' s very unjust ," was heard . The little assembly , though under evident constraint , could no longer suppress their indignation . " Who says it ' s unjust ?" cried the tyrant , sternly , looking down upon his judges . Susan ' s little brothers had held her gown fast , to prevent her from moving at the beginning of this contest , and she was now so much interested to see the end of it , that she stood still , without making any resistance . " Is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of silver ?" said the old man . " Yes , here ' s the butcher ' s boy ," said the attorney ' s son ; " show it to him ." He was a sickly - looking boy , and of a remarkably peaceful disposition . Young Case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment against him . However , after some moments ' hesitation , and after turning the shilling round several times ,	l
. Besides this treasure , she calculated that the amount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and thirty shillings ; and as her father was now sure of a week ' s reprieve , she had great hopes that , by some means or other , it would be possible to make up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute . " If that could but be done ," said she to herself , " how happy would my mother be . She would be quite stout again , for she	s
a good breed , and well reared from the first ." " Come , lads , don ' t keep a crowd and a scandal about my door ," continued he , aloud , to the children ; " turn the lamb in here , John , in the paddock , for to - night , and go your ways home ." The crowd dispersed , but murmured , and the butcher went to the attorney . " Seeing that all you want is a good , fat , tender lamb , for a present for Sir Arthur , as	s
vaunting of her own generosity , and part of it she did not like to recollect . But her mother pressed to know the whole , and she related it as simply as she could . When she came to the story of her lamb , her voice faltered , and everybody present was touched . The old harper sighed once , and cleared his throat several times . He then asked for his harp , and , after tuning it for a considerable time , he recollected -- for he had often fits of absence -- that he sent for it to play the tune he had promised to the boys . This harper came from a great distance , from the mountains of Wales , to contend with several other competitors for a prize , which had been advertised by a musical society about a year before this time . There was to be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at Shrewsbury , which was about five miles from our village . The prize was ten guineas for the best performer on the harp , and the prize was now to be decided in a few days	l
bargaining with her father about Susan ' s lamb , a servant from the Abbey rapped at the door , and left a card for Mr . and Miss Barbara Case . " There ," cried Bab , " _I_ and PAPA are to dine and drink tea at The Abbey tomorrow . Who knows ? I daresay , when they see that I ' m not a vulgar person , and all that ; and if I go cunningly to work with Miss Somers , as I shall , to be sure , I daresay , she ' ll take me to the ball with her ." " To be sure ," said the maid ; " it ' s the least one may expect from a lady who DEMEANS herself to visit Susan Price , and goes about a - shopping for her . The least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage , WHICH costs nothing , but is just a common civility , to a ball ." " Then pray , Betty ," continued Miss Barbara , " don ' t forget to - morrow , the first thing you do	l
, to send off to Shrewsbury for my new bonnet . I must have it to DINE IN , at the Abbey , or the ladies will think nothing of me ; and Betty , remember the mantua - maker too . I must see and coax papa to buy me a new gown against the ball . I can see , you know , something of the fashions to - morrow at the Abbey . I shall LOOK THE LADIES WELL OVER , I promise you . And , Betty , I have thought of the most charming present	s
dress , agree with the picture her imagination had formed of fashionable ladies . She was embarrassed when she saw books and work and drawings upon the table , and she began to think that some affront was meant to her , because the COMPANY did not sit with their hands before them . When Miss Somers endeavoured to find out conversation that would interest her , and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening , of which she was herself fond , Miss Barbara still thought herself undervalued , and soon contrived to expose her ignorance most completely ,	s
; but it came just whilst Miss Somers was dressing ; and the housekeeper came into her mistress ' room to announce its arrival . " Ma ' am ," said she , " here ' s a beautiful guinea - hen just come , with Miss Barbara Case ' s compliments to you ." Miss Somers knew , by the tone which the housekeeper delivered this message , that there was something in the business which did not perfectly please her . She made no answer , in expectation that the housekeeper , who was a woman of a very open temper , would explain her cause of dissatisfaction . In this she was not mistaken . The housekeeper came close up to the dressing table , and continued , " I never like to speak till I ' m sure , ma ' am , and I ' m not quite sure , to say certain , in this case , ma ' am , but still I think it right to tell you , which can ' t wrong anybody , what came across my mind about this same guinea - hen , ma ' am ;	l
my eyes don ' t strangely mistake , this hen , that comes from Miss Barbara , is the selfsame identical guinea - hen that I gave to Susan . And how Miss Bab came by it is the thing that puzzles me . If my boy Philip was at home , maybe , as he ' s often at Mrs . Price ' s ( which I don ' t disapprove ), he might know the history of the guinea - hen . I expect him home this night , and if you have no objection , I will sift the affair ." " The shortest way , I think ," said Henrietta , " would be to ask Miss Case herself about it , which I will do this evening ." " If you please , ma ' am ," said the housekeeper , coldly ; for she knew that Miss Barbara was not famous in the village for speaking truth . Dinner was now served . Attorney Case expected to smell mint sauce , and , as the covers were taken from off the dishes , looked around for lamb ; but no lamb appeared . He	l
had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation to his point . Sir Arthur was speaking , when they sat down to dinner , of a new carving knife , which he lately had had made for his sister . The attorney immediately went from carving - knives to poultry ; thence to butcher ' s meat . Some joints , he observed , were much more difficult to carve than others . He never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him , who was the curate of the parish . " But , sir ," said	s
-- and indignation , unrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators , flashed in his countenance . " What is the matter , Philip ?" said Miss Somers , in a pacifying tone ; but Philip was not inclined to be pacified . " Why , ma ' am ," said he , " may I speak out ?" and , without waiting for permission , he spoke out , and gave a full , true , and warm account of Rose ' s embassy , and of Miss Barbara ' s cruel and avaricious proceedings . Barbara denied , prevaricated , stammered , and at last was overcome with confusion ; for which even the most indulgent spectators could scarcely pity her . Miss Somers , however , mindful of what was due to her guest , was anxious to dispatch Philip for his piece of sycamore . Bab recovered herself as soon as he was out of sight ; but she further exposed herself by exclaiming , " I ' m sure I wish this pitiful guinea - hen had never come into my possession . I wish Susan had kept it at home , as	l
to keep wringing the hearts of the living , that have as much sense as one ' s self , is what I call cruel ; and is not this what Attorney Case has been doing by poor Susan and her whole family , ever since he took a spite against them ? But , at anyrate , here ' s Susan ' s lamb safe and sound . I ' d have taken it back sooner , but I was off before day to the fair , and am but just come back . Daisy , however , has been as well off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside ." The obliging shopkeeper , who showed the pretty calicoes to Susan , was now at his door , and when he saw the lamb , and heard that it was Susan ' s , and learned its history , he said that he would add his mite ; and he gave the children some ends of narrow riband , with which Rose decorated her friend ' s lamb . The pipe and tabor now once more began to play , and	l
from his visit to the Abbey . He saw the lamb , and tried to whistle as he went on . Barbara also saw the guinea - hen , and turned her head another way , that she might avoid the contemptuous , reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to despise . Even her new bonnet , in which she had expected to be so much admired , was now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her mortification . " I am glad she saw the guinea - hen ," cried Rose , who now held it in her hands . " Yes ," said Philip , " she ' ll not forget May day in a hurry ." " Nor I neither , I hope ," said Susan , looking round upon her companions with a most affectionate smile : " I hope , whilst I live , I shall never forget your goodness to me last May day . Now I ' ve my pretty guinea - hen safe once more , I should think of returning your money ." " No ! no ! no !" was the general cry . " We	l
day , felt considerable mortification , but no contrition . She was vexed that her meanness was discovered , but she felt no desire to cure herself of any of her faults . The ball was still uppermost in her vain , selfish soul . " Well ," said she to her confidante , Betty , " you hear how things have turned out ; but if Miss Somers won ' t think of asking me to go out with her , I ' ve a notion I know who will . As papa says , it ' s a	s
good thing to have two strings to one ' s bow ." Now , some officers , who were quartered at Shrewsbury , had become acquainted with Mr . Case . They had gotten into some quarrel with a tradesman of the town , and Attorney Case had promised to bring them through the affair , as the man threatened to take the law of them . Upon the faith of this promise , and with the vain hope that , by civility , they might dispose him to bring in a REASONABLE bill of costs , these officers sometimes invited Mr . Case to the mess ; and one of them , who had lately been married , prevailed upon his bride SOMETIMES to take a little notice of Miss Barbara . It was with this lady that Miss Barbara now hoped to go to the harpers ' ball . " The officers and Mrs . Strathspey , or , more properly , Mrs . Strathspey and the officers , are to breakfast here , tomorrow , do you know ," said Bab to Betty . " One of them dined at the Abbey , to - day ,	l
' s hand , saying , " A penny , if you please -- here ' s a letter for your father ." " For me !" said Farmer Price ; " here ' s the penny then , but who can it be from , I wonder ? Who can think of writing to me , in this world ?" He tore open the letter ; but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled him - -" your obliged friend , Llewellyn ." " And what ' s this ?" said he , opening a paper that was inclosed in the letter . " It ' s a song , seemingly ; it must be somebody that has a mind to make an April fool of me ." " But it is not April , it is May , father ," said Susan . " Well , let us read the letter , and we shall come to the truth all in good time ." Farmer Price sat down in his own chair , for he could not read entirely to his satisfaction in any other , and read as follows :-- " MY WORTHY FRIEND	l
Let us go and see this nook ," said Sir Arthur . " It is not far off , is it ?" " Oh , no , sir , just hard by here ." When they got to the ground , Mr . Case , who saw them walking together , was in a hurry to join them , that he might put a stop to any explanations . Explanations were things of which he had a great dread ; but , fortunately , he was upon this occasion a little too late . " Is this the nook in dispute ?" said Sir Arthur . " Yes ; this is the whole thing ," said Price . " Why , Sir Arthur ," interposed the politic attorney , with an assumed air of generosity , " don ' t let us talk any more about it . Let it belong to whom it will , I give it up to you ." " So great a lawyer , Mr . Case , as you are ," replied Sir Arthur , " must know , that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title ;	l
and in this case it is impossible that , with the best intentions to oblige me in the world , you can give up this bit of land to me , because it is mine already , as I can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land , which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers . This piece of ground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road , and it was cut off when the lane was made ." " Very possibly . I daresay you are quite correct ; you must	s
his possession . I hope I never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone ." " Heaven forbid , sir ," said the attorney , sanctifying his face , " that I should suggest the taking an UNFAIR advantage of any man , rich or poor ; but to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage ." " You really think so ?" said Sir Arthur . " Certainly I do , and I hope I have not hazarded your good opinion by speaking my mind concerning the flaw so plainly . I always understood that there	s
could be nothing ungentlemanlike , in the way of business , in taking advantage of a flaw in a lease ." " Now ," said Sir Arthur , " you have pronounced judgment undesignedly in your own case . You intended to send me this poor man ' s lease ; but your son , by some mistake , brought me your own , and I have discovered a fatal error in it ." " A fatal error !" said the alarmed attorney . " Yes , sir ," said Sir Arthur , pulling the lease out of his pocket . " Here it is . You will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the grantor ." " But , you won ' t take advantage of me , surely , Sir Arthur ?" said Mr . Case , forgetting his own principles . " I shall not take advantage of you , as you would have taken of this honest man . In both cases I shall be guided by memoranda which I have in my possession . I shall not , Mr . Case , defraud you of one shilling of your property . I	l
am ready , at a fair valuation , to pay the exact value of your house and land ; but upon this condition -- that you quit the parish within one month !" Attorney Case was thus compelled to submit to the hard necessity of the case , for he knew that he could not legally resist . Indeed he was glad to be let off so easily ; and he bowed and sneaked away , secretly comforting himself with the hope , that when they came to the valuation of the house and land he should be the gainer	s
you will be very happy with your little friends upon their play - green . I shall tell them that it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them ; and if you have anything to ask , any little favour for any of your companions , which we can grant , now ask , Susan . These ladies look as if they would not refuse you anything that is reasonable ; and , I think , you look as if you would not ask anything unreasonable ." " Sir ," said Susan , after consulting her mother ' s eyes , " there is , to be sure , a favour I should like to ask ; it is for Rose ." " Well , I don ' t know who Rose is ," said Sir Arthur , smiling ; " but , go on ." " Ma ' am , you have seen her , I believe ; she is a very good girl , indeed ," said Mrs . Price . " And works very neatly , indeed ," continued Susan , eagerly , to Miss Somers ; " and she and her mother heard	l
be large enough for everybody to have a slice , and the housekeeper will ice it for you . I only hope your cake will be as good as your bread . Fare ye well ." How happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family , silent with gratitude , who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing ! " How do I wish , now ," said Farmer Price , " and it ' s almost a sin for one that has had such a power of favours done him , to wish for anything more ; but how I DO wish , wife , that our good friend , the harper was only here at this time . It would do his old , warm heart good . Well , the best of it is , we shall be able next year , when he comes his rounds , to pay him his money with thanks , being all the time , and for ever , as much obliged to him as if we kept it . I long , so I do , to see him in this house again ,	l
drinking , as he did , just in this spot , a glass of Susan ' s mead , to her very good health ." " Yes ," said Susan , " and the next time he comes , I can give him one of my guinea - hen ' s eggs , and I shall show my lamb , Daisy ." " True , love ," said her mother , " and he will play that tune and sing that pretty ballad . Where is it ? for I have not finished it ." " Rose ran away with	s
it , mother , but I ' ll step after her , and bring it back to you this minute ," said Susan . Susan found her friend Rose at the hawthorn , in the midst of a crowded circle of her companions , to whom she was reading " Susan ' s Lamentation for her Lamb ." " The words are something , but the tune -- the tune -- I must have the tune ," cried Philip . " I ' ll ask my mother to ask Sir Arthur to try and find out which way that good old man went after the ball ; and if he ' s above ground , we ' ll have him back by Susan ' s birthday , and he shall sit here -- just exactly here by this , our bush , and he shall play -- I mean , if he pleases -- that same tune for us , and I shall learn it -- I mean , if I can -- in a minute ." The good news that Farmer Price was to be employed to collect the rents , and that Attorney Case was to leave the	l
here in your honour ' s presence , if he ' d only come out this minute , and meet me like a man ." Here Mr . Cox put himself into a boxing attitude , but observing that Mr . Somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile , and that several people , who had gathered round him as he stood in the street , laughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition , he changed his attitude , and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of drinking . " And as to	s
see the new house . " Yes , sir ," said the boy , " I should like to go up those stairs , and to see what I should come to ." " Up with you , then !" said Mr . Somerville ; and the boy ran up the stairs . He went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and delight . At length , as he was examining one of the garrets , he was startled by a fluttering noise over his head ; and looking up , he saw a white pigeon , who , frightened at his appearance , began to fly round and round the room , till it found its way out of the door , and flew into the staircase . The carpenter was speaking to Mr . Somerville upon the landing - place of the stairs ; but , the moment he spied the white pigeon , he broke off in the midst of a speech about THE NOSE of the stairs , and exclaimed , " There he is , please your honour ! There ' s he that has done all the damage to our bow	l
yard ; and the pigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen , and eat off the same trencher with the dog . Brian , after the shop was shut up at night , used to amuse himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him . Amongst these he one evening met with a little book full of the history of birds and beasts ; he looked immediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds , and , to his great joy , he found a full description and history of his favourite bird . " So , Brian , I see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you ; you like your book , I see , when you have no master over you to bid you read ," said his father , when he came in and saw Brian reading his book very attentively . " Thank you for having me taught to read , father ," said Brian . " Here I ' ve made a great discovery : I ' ve found out	l
better chance of making a fortune by the shop than by the white pigeon ." Brian never neglected the shop ; but in his leisure hours he amused himself with training his pigeon ; and after much patience he at last succeeded so well , that one day he went to his father and offered to send him word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of Ballynagrish , where he was going . " The pigeon will be home long before me , father ; and he will come in at the kitchen window ,	s
" He ' s six miles off ," said another ; and a third wished that he could make him hear at that distance . This turned the discourse upon the difficulties of sending messages secretly and quickly . Cox ' s son , a lad of about nineteen , who was one of this gang , mentioned the white carrier - pigeon , and he was desired to try all means to get it into his possession . Accordingly , the next day young Cox went to Brian O ' Neill , and tried , at first by persuasion	s
-- kip the pigeon untill to - morrow . For ever yours , MURTAGH COX , JUN ." Scarcely had they finished reading this note , than both father and son exclaimed , " Let us go and show it to Mr . Somerville ." Before they set out , they had , however , the prudence to secure the pigeon , so that he should not be seen by anyone but themselves . Mr . Somerville , in consequence of this fortunate discovery , took proper measures for the apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob	s
with a smile ; and he brought the pigeon to Mr . Somerville when it was dark , and nobody saw him . A few days afterwards , Mr . Somerville called at O ' Neill ' s house , and bid him and his son follow him . They followed till he stopped opposite to the bow - window of the new inn . The carpenter had just put up a sign , which was covered over with a bit of carpeting . " Go up the ladder , will you ?" said Mr . Somerville to Brian , " and pull that sign straight , for it hangs quite crooked . There , now it is straight . Now pull off the carpet , and let us see the new sign ." The boy pulled off the cover , and saw a white pigeon painted upon the sign , and the name of O ' Neill in large letters underneath . " Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful occasion ," said Mr . Somerville , who saw that Brian ' s surprise was too great for his situation . "	l
her ." " I did not say VERY fond ." " Well , but I don ' t think I am at all fond of her ." " But you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her ." " Yes , and all my half guinea besides ." " Yet you think her silly , and you are not fond of her at all ; and you say you know this thing will be of no use to her ." " But it is her birthday , sir ; and I am sure she will EXPECT	s
something , and everybody else will give her something ." " Then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her something . And will you , or can you , or should you , always give , merely because others EXPECT , or because somebody else gives ?" " Always ?-- no , not always ." " Oh , only on birthdays ." Rosamond , laughing : " Now you are making a joke of me , papa , I see ; but I thought you liked that people should be generous ,-- my godmother said that she did ." " So do I , full as well as your godmother ; but we have not yet quite settled what it is to be generous ." " Why is it not generous to make presents ?" said Rosamond . " That is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to answer . But , for instance , to make a present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem , because it is her birthday , and because everybody gives	l
Bell , impatiently ; " I can ' t wait till then ; I must see it this minute ." The maid refused her several times , till Bell burst into another fit of crying , and the maid , fearing that her mistress would be angry with HER , if Bell ' s eyes were red at dinner time , consented to show her the basket . " How pretty !-- but let me have it in my own hands ," said Bell , as the maid held the basket up out of her reach . " Oh ,	s
replied the maid , " what makes people so poor , I WONDERS ! I wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse , as I told her , and not of these folks . Call again ! yes , to be sure . I believe you ' d call , call , call twenty times for twopence ." However ungraciously the permission to call again was granted , it was received with gratitude . The little girl departed with a cheerful countenance ; and Bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long wished -	s
into your head , child , to dislike it ? Was it Nancy ?" " No , not Nancy , but THEM , mamma ," said Bell , pointing to Laura and Rosamond . " Oh , fie ! don ' t POINT ," said her mother , putting down her stubborn finger ; " nor say THEM , like Nancy ; I am sure you misunderstood . Miss Laura , I am sure , did not mean any such thing ." " No , madam ; and I did not say any such thing , that I recollect ," said Laura , gently . " Oh , no , indeed !" cried Rosamond , warmly , rising in her sister ' s defence . No defence or explanation , however , was to be heard , for everybody had now gathered round Bell , to dry her tears , and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs . They succeeded so well , that in about a quarter of an hour the young lady ' s eyes , and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour ; and the	l
, and the filigree basket appeared in all its glory . " Well , this is a charming present , indeed !" said the godmother , who was one of the company ; " MY Rosamond knows how to make presents ." And as she spoke , she took hold of the basket , to lift it down to the admiring audience . Scarcely had she touched it , when , lo ! the basket fell to the ground , and only the handle remained in her hand . All eyes were fixed upon the wreck . Exclamations of sorrow were heard in various tones ; and " Who can have done this ?" was all that Rosamond could say . Bell stood in sullen silence , which she obstinately preserved in the midst of the inquiries that were made about the disaster . At length the servants were summoned , and amongst them , Nancy , Miss Bell ' s maid and governess . She affected much surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket , and declared that she knew nothing of the matter , but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it	l
never come into my house again ." " Oh , that would not comfort me at all ," said Rosamond ; " besides , we are not sure that she did it , and if --" A single knock at the door was heard at this instant . It was the little girl , who came to be paid for her lace . " Call her in ," said the lady of the house ; " let us see her directly ." The maid , who was afraid that the girl ' s innocence would appear if she were produced	s
however , did believe ; and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her feel rather ashamed . " What do you all look at me so for ? Why do you all look so ? And am I to be put to shame on my birthday ?" cried she , bursting into a roar of passion ; " and all for this nasty thing !" added she , pushing away the remains of the basket , and looking angrily at Rosamond . " Bell ! Bell ! O , fie ! fie !-- Now I	s
where she thought Laura was . " Where is Laura ? I don ' t see her ." Laura came forward . " You are too PRUDENT to throw away your money like your sister . Your half - guinea , I ' ll answer for it , is snug in your pocket -- Is it not ?" " No , madam ," answered she , in a low voice . But low as the voice of Laura was , the poor little lace - girl heard it ; and now , for the first time , fixing her eyes	s

to tie it up . The parcel was but loosely folded up , and as the impatient man lifted it , the weight of the peas which were withinside of it burst the paper , and all the seeds fell out upon the floor , whilst Maurice in vain held his hands to catch them . The peas rolled to all parts of the shop ; the impatient man swore at them , but Maurice , without being out of humour , set about collecting them as fast as possible . Whilst the boy was busied in this manner ,	s
the man got what seeds he wanted ; and as he was talking about them , a sailor came into the shop , and said , " Captain , the wind has changed within these five minutes , and it looks as if we should have ugly weather ." " Well , I ' m glad of it ," replied the rough faced man , who was the captain of a ship . " I am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore , and I ' ve business enough on my hands ." The captain pushed forward towards the shop door . Maurice , who was kneeling on the floor , picking up his seeds , saw that the captain ' s foot was entangled in some packthread which hung down from the shelf on which the china jar stood . Maurice saw that , if the captain took one more step forward , he must pull the string , so that it would throw down the jar , round the bottom of which the packthread was entangled . He immediately caught hold of the captain ' s leg , and stopped him . " Stay !	l
I ' ll promise you that you will have the finest tulips in England in your little garden . These tulips were given to me by a Dutch merchant , who told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in Holland . They will prosper with you , I ' m sure , wind and weather permitting ." Maurice thanked the gentleman , and returned home , eager to show his precious tulip - roots to his father , and to a companion of his , the son of a nurseryman , who lived near him .	s
Arthur was the name of the nurseryman ' s son . The first thing Maurice did , after showing his tulip - roots to his father , was to run to Arthur ' s garden in search of him . Their gardens were separated only by a low wall of loose stones : " Arthur ! Arthur ! where are you ? Are you in your garden ! I want you ." But Arthur made no answer , and did not , as usual , come running to meet his friend . " I know where you are ," continued Maurice , " and I ' m coming to you as fast as the raspberry - bushes will let me . I have good news for you -- something you ' ll be delighted to see , Arthur !-- Ha !-- but here is something that I am not delighted to see , I am sure ," said poor Maurice , who , when he had got through the raspberry - bushes , and had come in sight of his own garden , beheld his bell - glass -- his beloved bell - glass , under which his cucumbers were	l
by these wonderful fine raspberries ?" said Mr . Oakly , one evening , to the gardener . " That ' s a secret ," replied Grant , with an arch smile . " Oh , in case it ' s a secret , I ' ve no more to say ; for I never meddle with any man ' s secrets that he does not choose to trust me with . But I wish , neighbour Grant , you would put down that book . You are always poring over some book or another when a man comes to see you , which is not , according to my notions ( being a plain , UNLARNED Englishman bred and born ), so civil and neighbourly as might be ." Mr . Grant hastily shut his book , but remarked , with a shrewd glance at his son , that it was in that book he found his Brobdingnag raspberries . " You are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as book - LARNED as yourself , Mr . Grant ; but I take it , being only a plain spoken Englishman ,	l
year . Here ' s to the health of you and yours , not forgetting the seedling larches , which I see are coming on finely ." " Thank ye , neighbour , kindly ; the larches are coming on tolerably well , that ' s certain ; and here ' s to your good health , Mr . Grant -- you and yours , not forgetting your , what dye call ' em raspberries "--( drinks )-- and , after a pause , resumes , " I ' m not apt to be a beggar , neighbour , but if you could give me --" Here Mr . Oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers , and he did finish making his request -- Mr . Oakly was not , as he said of himself , apt to ask favours , and nothing but Grant ' s cordiality could have conquered his prejudices , so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a Scotchman . He was going to have asked for some of the Brobdingnag raspberry - plants . The next day the thought of the raspberry - plants recurred to his memory	l
play - fellow for ye , child , if that be all ." " That ' s not all , father ," said Arthur , trying to stop himself from sobbing ; " but the thing is , I shall never have such another play - fellow ,- - I shall never have such another friend as Maurice Grant ." " Like father like son -- you may think yourself well off to have done with him ." " Done with him ! Oh , father , and shall I never go again to work in his garden , and may not he come to mine ?" " No ," replied Oakly , sturdily ; " his father has used me uncivil , and no man shall use me uncivil twice . I say no . Wife , sweep up this hearth . Boy , don ' t take on like a fool ; but eat thy bacon and greens , and let ' s hear no more of Maurice Grant ." Arthur promised to obey his father . He only begged that he might once more speak to Maurice , and tell him that it was by his father	l
lay upon the wall . " I fancy , father ," said he , " those things are for you , for there is a little note directed to you , in Maurice ' s handwriting . Shall I bring it to you ?" " Yes , let me read it , child , since I must ." It contained these words : " DEAR MR . OAKLY ,-- I don ' t know why you have quarrelled with us ; I am very sorry for it . But though you are angry with me , I am not angry with you . I hope you will not refuse some of my Brobdingnag raspberry - plants , which you asked for a great while ago , when we were all good friends . It was not the right time of the year to plant them , which was the reason they were not sent to you ; but it is just the right time to plant them now ; and I send you the book , in which you will find the reason why we always put seaweed ashes about their roots ; and I have got some seaweed ashes	l
for you . You will find the ashes in the flower - pot upon the wall . I have never spoken to Arthur , nor he to me , since you bid us not . So , wishing your Brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours , and longing to be all friends again , I am , with love to dear Arthur and self , " Your affectionate neighbour ' s son , " MAURICE GRANT . " P . S .-- It is now about four months since the quarrel began , and that is a	s
very long while ." A great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon Oakly , because he was not very expert in reading writing , and it cost him much trouble to spell it and put it together . However , he seemed affected by it , and said , " I believe this Maurice loves you well enough , Arthur , and he seems a good sort of boy ; but as to the raspberries , I believe all that he says about them is but an excuse ; and , at anyrate , as I could not get ' em when I asked for them , I ' ll not have ' em now . Do you hear me , I say , Arthur ? What are you reading there ?" Arthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book , which Maurice had left along with the raspberry - plants upon the wall . Arthur read aloud as follows :-- ( Monthly Magazine , Dec . ' 98 , p . 421 .) " There is a sort of strawberry cultivated at Jersey , which is almost covered with seaweed in	l
himself , " the best thing I can do , is , not to let it vex me . Forgive and forget ." This temper of mind Maurice was more happy in enjoying than he could have been made , without it , by the possession of all the tulips in Holland . Tulips were , at this time , things of great consequence in the estimation of the country several miles round where Maurice and Arthur lived . There was a florist ' s feast to be held at the neighbouring town , at which a prize of a handsome set of gardening - tools was to be given to the person who could produce the finest flower of its kind . A tulip was the flower which was thought the finest the preceding year , and consequently numbers of people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip - roots , in hopes of obtaining the prize this year . Arthur ' s tulip was beautiful . As he examined it from day to day , and every day thought it improving , he longed to thank his friend Maurice for it ; and he often mounted into his crab -	l
him , " Mr . Grant , your son has behaved very handsomely to my son ; and you seem to be glad of it ." " To be sure I am ," said Grant " Which ," continued Oakly , " gives me a better opinion of you than ever I had before -- I mean , than ever I had since the day you sent me the shabby answer about those foolish , what d ' ye call em , cursed raspberries ." " What shabby answer ?" said Grant , with surprise ; and Oakly repeated exactly the message which he received ; and Grant declared that he never sent any such message . He repeated exactly the answer which he really sent , and Oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him , saying " I believe you : no more need be said . I ' m only sorry I did not ask you about this four months ago ; and so I should have done if you had not been a Scotchman . Till now , I never rightly liked a Scotchman . We may thank this good little fellow ," continued he ,	l
turning to Maurice , " for our coming at last to a right understanding . There was no holding out against his good nature . I ' m sure , from the bottom of my heart , I ' m sorry I broke his tulip . Shake hands , boys ; I ' m glad to see you , Arthur , look so happy again , and hope Mr . Grant will forgive --" " Oh , forgive and forget ," said Grant and his son at the same moment . And from this time forward the two families lived	s
not propose to live in idleness and extravagance ; for such a life would have been equally incompatible with his habits and his principles . He was fond of children ; and as he had no sons , he determined to adopt one of his relations . He had two nephews , and he invited both of them to his house , that he might have an opportunity of judging of their dispositions , and of the habits which they had acquired . Hal and Benjamin , Mr . Gresham ' s nephews , were about ten years old .	s
cord . Ben took his parcel to a table , and , after breaking off the sealing wax , began carefully to examine the knot , and then to untie it . Hal stood still , exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his hands , and tried first at one corner , and then at another , to pull the string off by force . " I wish these people wouldn ' t tie up their parcels so tight , as if they were never to be undone ," cried he , as he tugged at	s
STRAWS with her . " That ' s right , Ben ; never be ashamed of being good - natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself ," said his uncle , smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord , to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cat ' s cradle . " I shall not think you one bit less manly , because I see you playing at cat ' s cradle with a little child of six years old ." Hal , however , was not precisely of his uncle '	s
the best part of it ! we boys are to have our turn , and Lady Di is to give a prize to the best marksman amongst us , of a very handsome bow and arrow ! Do you know , I ' ve been practising already , and I ' ll show you , to - morrow , as soon as it comes home , the FAMOUS bow and arrow that Lady Diana has given me ; but , perhaps ," added he , with a scornful laugh , " you like a cat ' s cradle better than a bow and arrow ." Ben made no reply to this taunt at the moment ; but the next day , when Hal ' s new bow and arrow came home , he convinced him that he knew how to use it very well . " Ben ," said his uncle , " you seem to be a good marksman , though you have not boasted of yourself . I ' ll give you a bow and arrow , and , perhaps , if you practise , you may make yourself an archer before the first of September ; and	l
never thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion , and that , amongst the number of their acquaintance , they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at such an UNNECESSARY expense . Hal stood amazed . " Such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand affairs of life ," said Mr . Gresham , looking at his nephews . " What amongst one set of people you hear asserted to be absolutely necessary , you will hear from another set of people is quite unnecessary . All that can be done , my dear boys , in these difficult cases , is to judge for yourselves , which opinions , and which people , are the most reasonable ." Hal , who had been more accustomed to think of what was fashionable , than of what was reasonable , without at all considering the good sense of what his uncle said to him , replied , with childish petulance , " Indeed , sir , I don ' t know what other people think ; but I only know what Lady Diana Sweepstakes said ." The name of Lady Diana Sweepstakes , Hal	l
the floor and walls . Mr . Gresham , who perceived that he was eager on all subjects to gain information , took this opportunity of telling him several things about the lost art of painting on glass , Gothic arches , etc ., which Hal thought extremely tiresome . " Come ! come ! we shall be late indeed ," said Hal ; " surely you ' ve looked long enough , Ben , at this blue and red window ." " I ' m only thinking about these coloured shadows ," said Ben . " I can show you when we go home , Ben ," said his uncle , " an entertaining paper upon such shadows ."* * Vide " Priestley ' s History of Vision ," chapter on coloured shadows . " Hark !" cried Ben , " did you hear that noise ?" They all listened ; and they heard a bird singing in the cathedral . " It ' s our old robin , sir ," said the lad who had opened the cathedral door for them . " Yes ," said Mr . Gresham , " there he is , boys -- look	l
-- perched upon the organ ; he often sits there , and sings , whilst the organ is playing ." " And ," continued the lad who showed the cathedral , " he has lived here these many , many winters . They say he is fifteen years old ; and he is so tame , poor fellow ! that if I had a bit of bread he ' d come down and feed in my hand ." " I ' ve a bit of bun here ," cried Ben , joyfully , producing the remains of the bun which	s
Hal but an hour before would have thrown away . " Pray , let us see the poor robin eat out of your hand ." The lad crumbled the bun , and called to the robin , who fluttered and chirped , and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread ; but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the organ . " He is afraid of US ," said Ben ; " he is not used to eat before strangers , I suppose ." " Ah , no , sir ," said the young man , with a deep sigh , " that is not the thing . He is used enough to eat afore company . Time was he ' d have come down for me before ever so many fine folks , and have eat his crumbs out of my hand , at my first call ; but , poor fellow ! it ' s not his fault now . He does not know me now , sir , since my accident , because of this great black patch ." The young man put his hand to his right eye , which was	l
it is not come yet -- I am sure , I should like to have a good warm great - coat very much ." Mr . Gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them before Hal , and three before Ben . " Young gentlemen ," said he , " I believe your uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece . Now I will lay out this money for you just as you please . Hal , what say you ?" " Why , sir ," said Hal , " a great - coat is a good thing , to be sure ; and then , after the great - coat , as you said it would only cost half as much as the uniform , there would be some money to spare , would not there ?" " Yes , my dear , about five - and - twenty shillings ." " Five - and - twenty shillings ?-- I could buy and do a great many things , to be sure , with five - and - twenty shillings ; but then , THE THING IS , I must go	l
mind -- here are your gloves which I asked you that night to let me mend . I ' ve been a great while about them ; but are not they not very neatly mended , papa ? Look at the sewing ." " I am not a very good judge of sewing , my dear little girl ," said Mr . Gresham , examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye ; " but , in my opinion , here is one stitch that is rather too long . The white teeth are not quite even ." " Oh , papa , I ' ll take out that long tooth in a minute ," said Patty , laughing ; " I did not think that you would observe it so soon ." " I would not have you trust to my blindness ," said her father , stroking her head , fondly ; " I observe everything . I observe , for instance , that you are a grateful little girl , and that you are glad to be of use to those who have been kind to you ; and for this I forgive you the long	l
them ," continued the lad , pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls worked in green and orange - coloured stripes . " They are but poor things , sir , she bid me say , to look at ; but , considering she has but one hand to work with , and that her left hand , you ' ll not despise ' em , we hopes ." He held the balls to Ben and Hal . " They are both alike , gentlemen ," said he . " If you ' ll be pleased to take '	s
or upon the facings of his uniform ; whilst all the time he was considered only as part of a show . The walk appeared much shorter than usual , and he was extremely sorry that Lady Diana , when they were half - way up the hill leading to Prince ' s Place , mounted her horse , because the road was dirty , and all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example . " We can leave the children to walk , you know ," said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount	s
her horse . " I must call to some of them , though , and leave orders where they are to join ." She beckoned : and Hal , who was foremost , and proud to show his alacrity , ran on to receive her ladyship ' s orders . Now , as we have before observed , it was a sharp and windy day ; and though Lady Diana Sweepstakes was actually speaking to him , and looking at him , he could not prevent his nose from wanting to be blowed : he pulled out his handkerchief and out rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left home , and which , according to his usual careless habits , he had stuffed into his pockets in his hurry . " Oh , my new ball !" cried he , as he ran after it . As he stopped to pick it up , he let go his hat , which he had hitherto held on with anxious care ; for the hat , though it had a fine green and white cockade , had no band or string round it . The	l
so strict in these laws , as he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself . Some of the boys had forgotten to bring more than one arrow with them , and by his cunning regulation that each person should shoot with their own arrows , many had lost one or two of their shots . " You are a lucky fellow ; you have your three arrows ," said young Sweepstakes . " Come , we can ' t wait whilst you rub your fingers , man --	s

You can ' t see him , so go about your business , I say . Lucy . To whom are you speaking , William ? Who ' s that ? Will . Only an old man , miss , with a complaint for my master . Lucy . Oh , then , don ' t send him away -- don ' t send him away . Will . But master has not had his chocolate , ma ' am . He won ' t ever see anybody before he drinks his chocolate , you know , ma ' am . Lucy . But let the old man , then , come in here . Perhaps he can wait a little while . Call him . ( Exit Servant .)

Oh , no , your worship !-- I thank your worship , though , as much as if I took it ; but I just took my luncheon before I came up ; or more proper , MY SANDWICH , I should say , for the fashion ' s sake , to be sure . A LUNCHEON won ' t go down with nobody nowadays ( laughs ). I expect hostler and boots will be calling for their sandwiches just now ( laughs again ). I ' m sure I beg your worship ' s pardon for mentioning a LUNCHEON . Just . Oh , Mrs . Bustle , the word ' s a good word , for it means a good thing -- ha ! ha ! ha ! ( pulls out his watch ); but pray , is it luncheon time . Why , it ' s past one , I declare ; and I thought I was up in remarkably	l
as you say , Mrs . Bustle ; so I shall have my goose - pie for dinner , hey ? Land . For dinner , as sure as the clock strikes four -- but I mustn ' t stay prating , for it may be spoiling if I ' m away ; so I must wish your worship a good morning . ( She curtsies .) Just . No ceremony -- no ceremony ; good Mrs . Bustle , your servant . Enter William , to take away the chocolate . The Landlady is putting on her shawl . Just . You may let that man know , William , that I have dispatched my OWN business , and am at leisure for his now ( taking a pinch of snuff ). Hum ! pray , William ( Justice leans back gravely ), what sort of a looking fellow is he , pray ? Will . Most like a sort of travelling man , in my opinion , sir -- or something that way , I take it , ( At these words the landlady turns round inquisitively , and delays , that she may listen , while she	l

Yes , forsooth ! none such ever slept at the " Saracen ' s Head " afore , or shall afterwards , as long as my name ' s Bustle , and the " Saracen ' s Head " is the " Saracen ' s Head ." Just . Again ! again ! Mrs . Landlady , this is downright -- I have said you should speak presently . He SHALL speak first , since I ' ve said it -- that ' s poz ! Speak on , friend . You slept last night at the " Saracen ' s Head ." Old M . Yes , please your worship , and I accuse nobody ; but at night I had my little money safe , and in the morning it was gone . Land .

I couldn ' t but speak , your worship , to such an inhuman like , out o ' the way , scandalous charge , if King George and all the Royal	l

Here , William ( showing the committal ), take this old gentleman to Holdfast , the constable , and give him this warrant . Enter Lucy , running , out of breath . Lucy . I ' ve found it ! I ' ve found it ! Here , old man ; here ' s your money -- here it is all -- a guinea and a half , and a shilling and a sixpence , just as he said , papa . Enter LANDLADY . Land . Oh la ! your worship , did you ever hear the like ? Just . I ' ve heard nothing yet that I can understand . First , have you secured the thief , I say ? Lucy ( makes signs to the landlady to be silent ). Yes , yes , yes !-- we have him safe -- we have him prisoner . Shall he come in , papa ? Just . Yes , child , by all means	l
. No , no , no ! because the thief was a magpie . No MAN would have taken the money and left the box . You see I was right ; no MAN would have left the box , hey ? Lucy . Certainly not , I suppose ; but I ' m so very glad , old man , that you have obtained your money . Just . Well then , child , here -- take my purse , and add that to it . We were a little too hasty with the committal -- hey ? Land . Ay , and I fear I was , too ; but when one is touched about the credit of one ' s house , one ' s apt to speak warmly . Old M . Oh , I ' m the happiest old man alive ! You are all convinced that I told you no lies . Say no more -- say no more . I am the happiest man ! Miss , you have made me the happiest man alive ! Bless you for it ! Land . Well now , I ' ll tell you what .	l
I know what I think -- you must keep that there magpie , and make a show of him , and I warrant he ' ll bring you many an honest penny ; for it ' s a TRUE STORY , and folks would like to hear it , I hopes -- Just .

Smack , the curate , and Squire Solid , and the doctor , sir , are come , and dinner is upon the table . Just . Then let us say no more ; but do justice immediately to the goose - pie ; and , darling , put me in mind to tell this story after dinner . ( After they go out , the Justice stops .) " Tell this story "-- I don ' t know whether it tells well for me ; but I ' ll never be positive any more -- THAT ' S	l
now anxious that the variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear in a just point of view . " Let children see and judge for themselves ," is often inconsiderately said . Where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole ; and from the superficial view which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation , they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human happiness , a false notion of the nature of society , and false opinions of characters . For the above reasons , Mr . and Mrs . Montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintances , as they were well aware that whatever passed in conversation before children became part of their education . When they came to Clifton they wished to have a house entirely to themselves , but , as they came late in the season , almost all the lodging houses were full , and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a house where some of the apartments were already occupied . During the first fortnight they scarcely	l
little probability of escaping Mrs . Tattle ' s further acquaintance . In the course of the first week she only hinted to Mr . Montague that " some people thought his system of education rather odd ; that she should be obliged to him if he would , some time or other , when he had nothing else to do , just sit down and make her understand his notions , that she might have something to say to her acquaintance , as she always wished to have when she heard any friend attacked , or any friend ' s opinions ." Mr . Montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say , and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened , Mrs . Tattle next addressed herself to Mrs . Montague , prophesying , in a most serious whisper , " that the charming Miss Marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked , if she were not immediately provided with a back - board , a French dancing - master , and a pair of stocks ." This alarming whisper	l
in the country which was likely to suit them , and they determined to go directly to look at it . As they were to be absent all day , they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children . They did not choose to exact any promise from them which they might be tempted to break , and therefore they only said at parting , " If Mrs . Theresa Tattle should ask you to come to her , do as you think proper ." Scarcely had Mrs . Montague ' s carriage got out of hearing when a note was brought , directed to " Frederick Montague , Junior , Esq .," which he immediately opened , and read as follows :-- " Mrs . Theresa Tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining Mr . Frederick Montague ; she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening , and bring his charming sister , Miss Marianne , with him , as Mrs . Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache , and is sensible her nerves are affected ; and Dr . Cardamum says that (	l
especially in Mrs . T . T .' s case ) it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant . She therefore trusts Mr . Frederick will not refuse to come and make her laugh . Mrs . Theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite , who said she was particularly fond of them the other day . Mrs . Theresa hopes they will all come at six , or before , not forgetting Miss Sophy , if she will condescend to be of the party ." At the first	s
from her drawing , and answered " that very likely those words might be signs of the same thing in the Latin grammar , but she believed that they meant perfectly different things in real life ." " That ' s just as people please ," said her sophistical brother . " You know words mean nothing in themselves . If I choose to call my hat my cadwallader , you would understand me just as well , after I had once explained it to you , that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I put upon my head ; cadwallader and hat would then be just the same thing to you ." " Then why have two words for the same thing ?" said Sophy ; " and what has this to do with ' could ' and ' should '? You wanted to prove --" " I wanted to prove ," interrupted Frederick , " that it ' s not worth while to dispute for two hours about two words . Do keep to the point , Sophy , and don ' t dispute with me ." " I was not disputing , I was reasoning	l
her hands and eyes to heaven , " and so much as she has gone through , the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will ; for turn it which way she will , she can never keep a carriage , or live like anybody else , on her jointure , after all , she tells me , poor soul ! A sad prospect , after her husband ' s death , to look forward to , instead of being comfortable , as her friends expected ; and she , poor young thing ! knowing no better when they married her ! People should look into these things , beforehand , or never marry at all , I say , Miss Marianne ." Miss Marianne , who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure , or the reason why Mrs . Carbuncle would be so unhappy after her husband ' s death , turned to Frederick , who was at that instant studying Mrs . Theresa as a future character to mimic . " Brother ," said Marianne , " now sing an Italian song for us	l
like Miss Croker . Pray , Miss Croker , favour us with a song . Mrs . Theresa Tattle has never had the pleasure of hearing you sing ; she ' s quite impatient to hear you sing ." " Yes , indeed , I am ," said Mrs . Theresa . Frederick put his hands before him affectedly ; " Oh , indeed , ma ' am ! indeed , ladies ! I really am so hoarse , it distresses me so to be pressed to sing ; besides , upon my word , I have quite left off	s
" Oh yes ; indeed you must not leave me without taking something ; and Miss Marianne must have another macaroon . I insist upon it ," said Mrs . Theresa , ringing the bell . " It is not late , and my man Christopher will bring up the cowslip - wine in a minute ." " But , Sophy ! and papa and mamma , you know , will come home presently ," said Marianne . " Oh ! Miss Sophy has her books and drawings . You know she ' s never afraid of being alone . Besides , to - night it was her own choice . And as to your papa and mamma , they won ' t be home to - night , I ' m pretty sure ; for a gentleman , who had it from their own authority , told me where they were going , which is further off than they think ; but they did not consult me ; and I fancy they ' ll be obliged to sleep out ; so you need not be in a hurry about them . We ' ll have candles ." The door	l
I have no brother , dunce ," said Mrs . Theresa . " Mr . Eden , madam ." " Ho , ho !" said Mrs . Tattle , in a more complacent tone , " the boy takes me for Miss Bertha Eden , I perceive "; and , flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney - sweeper for a young and handsome lady , Mrs . Theresa laughed , and informed him " that they had mistaken the room ; and they must go up another pair of stairs , and turn to the left	s
you please , I ' ll step down now , ma ' am , and see about the chimney - sweepers ." " Yes , step down , do ; and , Christopher , bring up the cowslip - wine , and some more macaroons for my little Marianne ." Marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which Mrs . Tattle was going to give her ; for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman . She had not been accustomed to these familiarities in her father and mother , and she	s
did not like them . " Well ," said Mrs . Tattle to Christopher , who was now returned , " what is the news ?" " Ma ' am , the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me the whole story . The other morning , ma ' am , early , he and the other were down the hill sweeping in Paradise Row . Those chimneys , they say , are difficult ; and the square fellow , ma ' am , the biggest of the two boys , got wedged in the chimney . The other little fellow was up at the top at the time , and he heard the cry ; but in his fright , and all , he did not know what to do , ma ' am ; for he looked about from the top of the chimney , and not a soul could he see stirring , but a few that he could not make attend to his screech ; the boy within almost stifling too . So he screeched , and screeched , all he could ; and by the greatest chance in life , ma '	l
and he ' s smarterer , and more mannerly , ma ' am , with a tongue in his head for his betters ), but he could not resolve me my question either ; for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part o ' the time : and when he came down Mr . Eden had his wig on , but had his arm all bare and bloody , ma ' am ." " Poor Mr . Eden !" exclaimed Marianne . " Oh , miss ," continued the servant , " and the chimney - sweep himself was so bruised , and must have been killed ." " Well , well ! but he ' s alive now ; go on with your story , Christopher ," said Mrs . T . " Chimney - sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day ; it ' s part of their trade , and it ' s a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises .* To be sure ," added she , observing that both Frederick and Marianne looked displeased at this speech , " to be sure , if one may	l
his days , for such an escape -- But pray , Christopher ," said she , persisting in her conversation with Christopher , who was now laying the cloth for supper , " pray , which house was it in Paradise Row ? where the Eagles or the Miss Ropers lodge ? or which ?" " It was at my Lady Battersby ' s , ma ' am ." " Ha ! ha !" cried Mrs . Theresa , " I thought we should get to the bottom of the affair at last . This is excellent ! This will make an admirable story for my Lady Battersby the next time I see her . These Quakers are so sly ! Old Eden , I know , has long wanted to obtain an introduction into that house ; and a charming charitable expedient hit upon ! My Lady Battersby will enjoy this , of all things ." CHAPTER III . " Now ," continued Mrs . Theresa , turning to Frederick , as soon as the servant had left the room , " now , Mr . Frederick Montague , I have a favour - - such a favour --	l
called false shame , and which often conquers real shame ; " to be sure , ma ' am , I may do as I please ." " Then I may make sure of you ," said Mrs . Theresa ; " for now it would be downright rudeness to tell a lady you won ' t do as she pleases . Mr . Frederick Montague , I ' m sure , is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so unpolite , so ungallant a thing !" The jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear good sense . A new and unintelligible system is presented to them , in a language foreign to their understanding , and contradictory to their feelings . They hesitate between new motives and old principles . From the fear of being thought ignorant , they become affected ; and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools . But all this they feel only when they are in the company of such people as Mrs . Theresa Tattle . " Ma ' am ," Frederick	l
better even than anything I ' ve seen to - night ; and I think you ' d make a capital Quaker for my Lady Battersby ; but then the thing is , one can never get to hear the old quiz talk . Now you , who have so much invention and cleverness -- I have no invention myself ; but could you not hit upon some way of seeing him , so that you might get him by heart ? I ' m sure you , who are so quick , would only want to see him ,	s
and hear him , for half a minute , to be able to take him off , so as to kill one with laughing . But I have no invention ." " Oh , as to the invention ," said Frederick , " I know an admirable way of doing the thing , if that is all ; but then remember , I don ' t say I will do the thing , for I will not . But I know a way of getting up into his room , and seeing him , without his knowing me to be there ." " Oh , tell it me , you charming , clever creature !" " But , remember , I do not say I will do it ." " Well , well , let us hear it ; and you shall do as you please afterwards . Merciful goodness !" exclaimed Mrs . Tattle , " do my ears deceive me ? I declare I looked round , and thought I heard the squeaking chimney - sweeper was in the room !" " So did I , Frederick , I declare ," cried Marianne , laughing , " I	l
; but wouldn ' t have , as I heard him say , his sister waked for no account . But Miss Bertha ' s bell will ring when she wakens for the sweeps , ma ' am . ' Twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved , and I suppose sent for him to give him something charitable , ma ' am ." " Well , never mind your suppositions ," said Mrs . Theresa ; " run down this very minute to the little squeaking chimney - sweep , and send him up to	s
clothes , " I think Frederick is right about --" " About what , love ?" " I think he is in the right not to go up , though he can do it so easily , to see that gentleman ; I mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards . I don ' t think that would be quite right ." " Why , pray , Miss Marianne ?" " Why , because he is so good - natured to his sister . He would not let her be wakened ." " Dear , it '	s
that ends well . Mr . Frederick , we ' ll keep your counsel . Pray , ma ' am , let us ask no questions ; it ' s only a boyish frolic . Come , Mr . Frederick , this way , into my room , and I ' ll give you a towel and some clean water , and you can get rid of this masquerade dress . Make haste , for fear your father and mother should drop in upon us ." " Do not be afraid of thy father and mother . They are surely thy best friends ," said a voice . It was the voice of an elderly gentleman , who now stood behind Frederick . " Oh , sir , oh , Mr . Eden ," said Frederick , turning to him . " Don ' t betray me ! for goodness ' sake !" whispered Mrs . Tattle , " say nothing about me ." " I ' m not thinking about you . Let me speak ," cried he , pushing away her hand , which stopped his mouth . " I shall say nothing about you , I promise	l
Your son ," concluded he , " will quickly put off his dirty dress . The dress hath not stained the mind ; that is fair and honourable . When he found himself in the wrong , he said so ; nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from his father ; this made me think well of both father and son . I speak plainly , friend , for that is best . But what is become of the other chimney - sweeper ? He will want to go home ," said Mr . Eden , turning to Mrs . Theresa . Without making any reply , she hurried out of the room as fast as possible , and returned in a few moments , with a look of extreme consternation . " Here is a catastrophe indeed ! Now , indeed , Mr . Frederick , your papa and mamma have reason to be angry . A new suit of clothes !-- the bare faced villain ! gone ! no sign of them in my closet , or anywhere . The door was locked ; he must have gone up the chimney , out upon the	l
some of the most credulous boys ; whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr . Middleton ' s impartiality . These warmly congratulated De Grey . At this Archer grew more and more angry , and when Fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense FOR him , pushed forward into the circle to De Grey , crying , " I wish , Mr . Fisher , you would let me fight my own battles !" " And _I_ wish ," said young Townsend , who was fonder of diversions than of premiums , or battles , or of anything else --" _I_ wish , that we were not to have any battles ; after having worked like horses , don ' t set about to fight like dogs . Come ," said he , tapping De Grey ' s shoulder , " let us see your new playhouse , do -- it ' s a holiday , and let us make the most of it . Let us have the ' School for Scandal ,' do ; and I ' ll play Charles for you , and you , De Grey , shall be MY LITTLE PREMIUM . Come ,	l
friend . And as no metaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever entered their thoughts , the most numerous party considered themselves as now beyond dispute in the right . They drew off on one side in triumph , and their leader , who knew the consequence of a name in party matters , immediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of ARCHERS , stigmatizing the friends of De Grey by the odious epithet of Greybeards . Amongst the Archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental qualifications ; but who , by their bodily activity , and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life , rendered themselves of the highest consequence , especially to the rich and enterprising . The judicious reader will apprehend that I allude to the persons called day scholars . Amongst these , Fisher was distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in the adjacent town ; and , though a dull scholar , he had such reputation as a man of business , that whoever had commissions to execute at the confectioner ' s , was sure to apply to him	l
. Some of the youngest of his employers had , it is true , at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their accounts ; but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial , Fisher ' s character and consequence were undiminished , till the fatal day when his Aunt Barbara forbade his visits to the confectioner ' s ; or , rather , till she requested the confectioner , who had his private reasons for obeying her , not TO RECEIVE her nephew ' s visits , as he had made	s
his various occupations , to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people . " O ye Athenians !" he exclaimed , " how hard do I work to obtain your praise !" Impatient to return to the theatre , the moment the hours destined for instruction , or , as they are termed by schoolboys , school - hours , were over , each prisoner started up with a shout of joy . " Stop one moment , gentlemen , if you please ," said Dr . Middleton , in an awful voice . " Mr . Archer , return to your place . Are you all here ?" The names of all the boys were called over , and when each had answered to his name , Dr . Middleton said -- " Gentlemen , I am sorry to interrupt your amusements ; but , till you have contrary orders from me , no one , on pain of my serious displeasure , must go into THAT building " ( pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting ). " Mr . Archer , your carpenter is at the door . You will be	l
Ay , ay !" said Archer , knowing that he had been cheated , and yet proud of managing a carpenter , " ay , ay ! I know the way to manage everybody . Let the things be ready in an hour ' s time , and hark ' e ! leave your tools by mistake behind you , and a thousand of twenty - penny nails . Ask no questions , and keep your own counsel like a wise man . Off with you , and take care of ' THE DOCTOR .'" " Archers , Archers ,	s
put his watch into the solemn dupe ' s hand , and left him to count the seconds , till the moment of his appointment , whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle . At a little gate which looked into a lane , through which he guessed that the gipsy must pass , he stationed himself , saw her , gave her half a crown and her instructions , made his escape , and got back unsuspected to Fisher , whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him , watching the motion of the minute hand . Proud of his secret commission , Fisher slouched his hat , he knew not why , over his face , and proceeded towards the appointed spot . To keep , as he had been charged by Archer , within the letter of the law , he stood BEHIND the forbidden building , and waited some minutes . Through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance , muffled up , and looking cautiously about her . " There ' s nobody near us !" said Fisher , and he began to	l
. A third conspirator was to strike a light , in case they should not be able to secure a candle . A fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted ; and all the rest were to run to their bars , which were secreted in a room ; then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window , in the manner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager . Thus each had his part assigned , and each was warned that the success of the whole depended upon their order and punctuality . Order and punctuality , it appears , are necessary even in a Barring Out ; and even rebellion must have its laws . The long expected moment at length arrived . De Grey and his friends , unconscious of what was going forward , walked out of the schoolroom as usual at bedtime . The clock began to strike nine . There was one Greybeard left in the room , who was packing up some of his books , which had been left about by accident . It is impossible to describe the impatience with	l
feet , so that it was in vain to think of reaching to the trap - door . As soon as the daylight appeared , Archer rose softly , that he might RECONNOITRE , and devise some method of guarding against this new danger . Luckily there were round holes in the top of the window - shutters , which admitted sufficient light for him to work by . The remains of the soaked feast , wet candles , and broken glass spread over the table in the middle of the room , looked rather dismal this morning . '	s
lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy fellow , to be sure ; but , then , if he has hands , he has no head -- and he ' d be afraid of his own shadow too , by this light , he is such a coward ! And Townsend , why , he has puns in plenty ; but , when there ' s any work to be done , he ' s the worst fellow to be near one in the world -- he can do nothing but laugh at his own puns . This poor	s
, and who had promised to come every day , and put food in at a certain hole in the wall , in which a ventilator usually turned . This ventilator Archer had taken down , and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure ; but , upon examination , it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back , which it was impossible to penetrate or remove . " It never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the ventilator but	s
regularly ." So he summoned a council , and proposed that everyone should subscribe , and trust the subscription to the gipsy , to purchase a fresh supply of provisions . Archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscription ; at which sight all the company clapped their hands , and his popularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty . Now , having made a list of their wants , they folded the money in the paper , put it into a bag , which Archer tied to a long string , and , having broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window - shutter , he let down the bag to the gipsy . She promised to be punctual , and having filled the bag with Fisher ' s twelve buns , they were drawn up in triumph , and everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinner - time . The buns were a little squeezed in being drawn through the hole in the window - shutter ; but Archer immediately sawed out a piece of the	l
want nothing but your good , you rebel against me . Traitors ! fools ! ungrateful fools !" Archer walked up and down , unable to command his emotion , whilst , for the moment , the discontented multitude was silenced . " Here ," said he , striking his hand upon the little boy ' s shoulder , " here ' s the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint , and he has had but one bit of bread -- a bit that I gave him myself this day . Here	s
shuttlecock - - no ball , no marbles . Some sat in a corner , whispering their wishes that Archer would unbar the doors , and give up . Others , stretching their arms , and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room , wished for air , or food , or water . Fisher and his nine , who had such firm dependence upon the gipsy , now gave themselves up to utter despair . It was eight o ' clock , growing darker and darker every minute , and no candles , no light could they have . The prospect of another long dark night made them still more discontented . Townsend , at the head of the yawners , and Fisher , at the head of the hungry malcontents , gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered spirits , demanding " How long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon ? and whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake ?" The idea of GIVING UP was more intolerable to Archer than all the rest . He saw that the majority , his own convincing argument , was against	l
, " there ' s a noble fellow ! there ' s my own cousin , I acknowledge . Fill the bag , then ." Several times the bag descended and ascended ; and at every unlading of the crane , fresh acclamations were heard . " I have no more !" at length the boy with the tailor ' s bag cried . " Off with you , then ; we ' ve enough , and thank you ." A delightful review was now made of their treasure . Busy hands arranged and sorted the heterogeneous mass . Archer	s
deserved , for his eye was fixed upon De Grey . " What is De Grey thinking of ?" he asked , impatiently . " I am thinking ," said De Grey , " that Dr . Middleton must believe that I have betrayed his confidence in me . The gardener was ordered away from his watch - post for one half - hour when I was admitted . This half - hour the gardener has made nearly a hour . I never would have come near you if I had foreseen all this . Dr . Middleton trusted me	s
never forgive us for that ." " Hush ! here he comes !" His steady step was heard approaching nearer and nearer . Archer threw open the door , and Dr . Middleton entered . Fisher instantly fell on his knees . " It is no delight to me to see people on their knees . Stand up , Mr . Fisher . I hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong ?" " Sir ," said Archer , " they are conscious that they have done wrong , and so am I . I am the ringleader	s
I have left ." Dr . Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him with a look of approbation , and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the schoolroom . The rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctor ' s sentence against them , but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster . " You shall return from the playground , all of you ," said Dr . Middleton , " one quarter of an hour sooner , for two months to come , than the rest of your companions . A bell shall ring at the appointed time . I give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality ." " Oh , sir ! we will come the instant , the very instant the bell rings ; you shall have confidence in us ," cried they , eagerly . " I deserve your confidence , I hope ," said Dr . Middleton ; " for it is my first wish to make you all happy . You do not know the pain that it has cost me to	l
more , CAN I ?" said she , again turning round to her companions . " No , to be sure ," said they ; " that ' s all fair ." Cecilia looked triumphantly at Leonora . Leonora let go her hand ; she ran on , and the crowd followed . When she got to the end of the garden , she turned round to see if Leonora had followed her , too ; but was vexed to see her still sitting on the steps with Louisa . " I ' m sure I can do no more than buy her another , CAN I !" said she , again appealing to her companions . " No , to be sure ," said they , eager to begin their play . How many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave off , before Cecilia could be satisfied with any ! Her thoughts were discomposed , and her mind was running upon something else . No wonder , then , that she did not play with her usual address . She grew still more impatient . She threw down the ninepins . " Come , let us play	l
desire to have such a friend , who would quarrel with me for happening to throw down little Louisa . How could I tell that she had a mandarin in her hand ? and when it was broken , could I do more than promise her another ; was that unjust ?" " But you know , Cecilia --" " I KNOW ," ironically . " I know , Leonora , that you love Louisa better than you love me ; that ' s the injustice !" " If I did ," replied Leonora , gravely , " it would	s
I ask you to tell me anything as your friend , I never punish you as your governess ; therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter ." " No , madam , I am not afraid , but ashamed . You asked me why I was not with my companions . Why , madam , because they have all left me , and --" " And what , my dear ?" " And I see that they all dislike me ; and yet I don ' t know why they should , for I take as much pains to please as any of them . All my masters seem satisfied with me ; and you yourself , madam , were pleased this very morning to give me this bracelet ; and I am sure you would not have given it to anyone who did not deserve it ." " Certainly not ," said Mrs . Villars . " You well deserve it for your application -- for your successful application . The prize was for the most assiduous , not for the most amiable ." " Then , if it had been for the	l
your companion . Therefore I must judge of what I should do , by seeing what others do in the same circumstances ." " Oh , pray don ' t , madam ! for then you would not love me either . And yet I think you would love me ; for I hope that I am as ready to oblige , and as good - natured as --" " Yes , Cecilia , I don ' t doubt but that you would be very good natured to me ; but I ' m afraid that I should not like you unless you were good - tempered , too ." " But , madam , by good - natured I mean good - tempered -- it ' s all the same thing ." " No , indeed , I understand by them two very different things . You are good - natured , Cecilia ; for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companions -- to gain them praise , and save them from blame -- to give them pleasure , and relieve them from pain ; but Leonora is good - tempered , for she can bear with	l
their foibles , and acknowledge her own . Without disputing about the right , she sometimes yields to those who are in the wrong . In short , her temper is perfectly good ; for it can bear and forbear ." " I wish that mine could !" said Cecilia , sighing . " It may ," replied Mrs . Villars ; " but it is not wishes alone which can improve us in anything . Turn the same exertion and perseverance which have won you the prize to - day to this object , and you will meet with	s
put that into your head ?" " Leonora said that I had , madam , and I felt ashamed when she said so ." " But , my dear , how can Leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad ? However , in the first place , tell me what you mean by a bad heart ." " Indeed I do not know what is meant by it , madam ; but it is something which everybody hates ." " And why do they hate it ?" " Because they think that it will hurt them , ma ' am , I believe : and that those who have bad hearts take delight in doing mischief ; and that they never do anybody any good but for their own ends ." " Then the best definition ," said Mrs . Villars , " which you can give me of a bad heart is , that it is some constant propensity to hurt others , and to do wrong for the sake of doing wrong ." " Yes , madam ; but that is not all either . There is still something else meant ; something which I cannot	l
just broken hers . In giving her change , the peddler took out of his pocket , with some halfpence , the very box which Cecilia had sold to him . Leonora did not in the least suspect the truth , for her mind was above suspicion ; and besides , she had the utmost confidence in Cecilia . " I should like to have that box ," said she , " for it is like one of which I was very fond ." The peddler named the price , and Leonora took the box . She intended to give it to little Louisa . On going to her room she found her asleep , and she sat softly down by her bedside . Louisa opened her eyes . " I hope I didn ' t disturb you ," said Leonora . " Oh , no . I didn ' t hear you come in ; but what have you got there ?" " Only a little box ; would you like to have it ? I bought on purpose for you , as I thought perhaps it would please you , because it ' s like that which I	l
Yes ," she replied calmly , " I see that ; but it is no proof that it is Cecilia ' s . You know that I bought this box just now of the peddler ." " That may be ," said Louisa ; " but I remember scratching that L with my own needle , and Cecilia scolded me for it , too . Do go and ask her if she has lost her box -- do ," repeated Louisa , pulling her by the ruffle , as she did not seem to listen . Leonora , indeed , did not hear , for she was lost in thought . She was comparing circumstances , which had before escaped her attention . She recollected that Cecilia had passed her as she came into the hall , without seeming to see her , but had blushed as she passed . She remembered that the peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box , and was going to put it again in his pocket with the halfpence . " And why should he keep it in his pocket , and not show it with his other things ?" Combining all these	l
. Overcome with heat and too violent exertion , she had hardly strength to support herself ; each moment appeared to her intolerably long . She was in a state of the utmost suspense , and all her courage failed her . Even hope forsook her ; and hope is a cordial which leaves the mind depressed and enfeebled . " The time is now come ," said Cecilia ; " in a few moments all will be decided . In a few moments -- goodness ! How much do I hazard ? If I should not win the prize , how shall I confess what I have done ? How shall I beg Leonora to forgive me ? I , who hoped to restore my friendship to her as an honour ! They are gone to seek for her . The moment she appears I shall be forgotten . What -- what shall I do ?" said Cecilia , covering her face with her hands . Such was Cecilia ' s situation when Leonora , accompanied by her companions , opened the hall door . They most of them ran forwards to Cecilia . As Leonora came into the	l
crowd divided . She had heard all that passed , from her window . " I applaud your generosity , Cecilia ," said she , " but I am to tell you that , in this instance it is unsuccessful . You have not it in your power to give the prize to Leonora . It is yours . I have another vote to give to you . You have forgotten Louisa ." " Louisa !" exclaimed Cecilia ; " but surely , ma ' am , Louisa loves Leonora better than she does me ." " She commissioned me	s
saw this silver box lying on the bed . I took it up , and asked if it was not yours , and how she came by it . ' Indeed , madam ,' said Louisa , ' I could have been almost certain that it was Cecilia ' s ; but Leonora gave it me , and she said that she bought it of the peddler this morning . If anybody else had told me so , I could not have believed them , because I remember the box so well ; but I can ' t help believing Leonora .' But did not you ask Cecilia about it ? said I . ' No , madam ,' replied Louisa ; ' for Leonora forbade me . I guessed her reason .' Well , said I , give me the box , and I will carry your shell in it to Cecilia . ' Then , madam ,' said she , ' if I must give it her , pray do take the Flora , and return it to her first , that she may not think it is for that I do it .'" " Oh , generous	l
best ." " Louisa ! oh , yes , Louisa ," exclaimed everybody with one voice . " Yes ," said Mrs . Villars , " and let Cecilia carry the bracelet to her ; she deserves that reward . For one fault I cannot forget all your merits , Cecilia , nor , I am sure , will your companions ." " Then , surely , not your best friend ," said Leonora , kissing her . Everybody present was moved . They looked up to Leonora with respectful and affectionate admiration . " Oh , Leonora , how I love you ! and how I wish to be like you !" exclaimed Cecilia --" to be as good , as generous !" " Rather wish , Cecilia ," interrupted Mrs . Villars , " to be as just ; to be as strictly honourable , and as invariably consistent . Remember , that many of our sex are capable of great efforts -- of making what they call great sacrifices to virtue or to friendship ; but few treat their friends with habitual gentleness , or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence and good sense ." THE LITTLE MERCHANTS	l
of them bring fish for sale to town from Santa Lucia ; others are very often seen about the arsenals , or wherever carpenters are at work , employed in gathering up the chips and pieces of wood ; or by the sea - side , picking up sticks , and whatever else has drifted ashore , which , when their basket is full , they carry away . " Children of two or three years old , who can scarcely crawl along upon the ground , in company with boys of five or six , are employed in this pretty trade . Hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of the city , where in several places they form a sort of little market , sitting round with their stock of wood before them . Labourers , and the lower order of citizens , buy it of them to burn in the tripods for warming themselves , or to use in their scanty kitchens . " Other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells , which , particularly in the spring season , is drunk in great abundance . Others again endeavour to	l
, and therefore all his companions trusted him --" As honest as Francisco ," became a sort of proverb amongst them . " As honest as Francisco ," repeated Piedro ' s father , when he one day heard this saying . " Let them say so ; I say , ' As sharp as Piedro '; and let us see which will go through the world best ." With the idea of making his son SHARP he made him cunning . He taught him , that to make a GOOD BARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of ; to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence . He often repeated his favourite proverb --" The buyer has need of a hundred eyes ; the seller has need but of one ." * And he took frequent opportunities of explaining the meaning of this maxim to his son . He was a fisherman ; and as his gains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence , he trusted habitually to his good luck . After being idle for a	l
father thinks you have done enough ?" " Not before MY FATHER thinks I have done enough , but before I think so myself ," replied Francisco . " I do enough to satisfy myself and my father , too ," said Piedro , " without slaving myself after your fashion . Look here ," producing the money he had received for the fish ; " all this was had for asking . It is no bad thing , you ' ll allow , to know how to ask for money properly ." " I should be ashamed to beg , or borrow either ," said Francisco . " Neither did I get what you see by begging , or borrowing either ," said Piedro , " but by using my wits ; not as you did yesterday , when , like a novice , you showed the bruised side of your melon , and so spoiled your market by your wisdom ." " Wisdom I think it still ," said Francisco . " And your father ?" asked Piedro . " And my father ," said Francisco . " Mine is of a different way of thinking ," said	l
if you would have let him . You ' ll allow I ' m no fool , Francisco , and that I ' m in a fair way to grow rich , if I go on as I have begun ." " Stay ," said Francisco ; " you forgot that the booby you took in to - day will not be so easily taken in to - morrow . He will buy no more fish from you , because he will be afraid of your cheating him ; but he will be ready enough to buy fruit from me , because he will know I shall not cheat him -- so you ' ll have lost a customer , and I gained one ." " With all my heart ," said Piedro . " One customer does not make a market ; if he buys no more from me , what care I ? there are people enough to buy fish in Naples ." " And do you mean to serve them all in the same manner ?" asked Francisco . " If they will be only so good as to give me leave ," said Piedro , laughing	l
, and repeating his father ' s proverb , "' Venture a small fish to catch a large one .'" * He had learned to think that to cheat in making bargains was witty and clever . * see anted . " And you have never considered , then ," said Francisco , " that all these people will , one after another , find you out in time ?" " Ay , in time ; but it will be some time first . There are a great many of them , enough to last me all the summer ,	s
, change my trade -- sell chips and sticks in the wood - market -- hand about the lemonade to the fine folks , or twenty other things . There are trades enough , boy ." " Yes , for the honest dealer ," said Francisco , " but for no other ; for in all of them you ' ll find , as MY father says , that a good character is the best fortune to set up with . Change your trade ever so often , you ' ll be found out for what you are at last	s
by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the day before by cheating the ENGLISH BOOBY . The market was well supplied , and he could not get rid of his cargo . " Is not this truly provoking ?" said Piedro , as he passed by Francisco , who was selling fruit for his father . " Look , my basket is as heavy as when I left home and look at ' em yourself , they really are fine fresh fish to - day and yet , because that revengeful booby told how I	s
. " We must , then , pick out the best for him ," at the same time singling out a tempting bunch . " I hope he will like these ; but if you could some day come as far as Resina ( it is a village but a few miles out of town , where we have our vineyard ), you could there choose for yourself , and pluck them fresh from the vines for your poor master ." " Bless you , my good boy ; I should take you for an Englishman , by your way of dealing . I ' ll come to your village . Only write me down the name ; for your Italian names slip through my head . I ' ll come to the vineyard if it was ten miles off ; and all the time we stay in Naples ( may it not be so long as I fear it will !), with my master ' s leave , which he never refuses me to anything that ' s proper , I ' ll deal with you for all our fruit , as sure as my name ' s Arthur	l
, and with none else , with my good will . I wish all your countrymen would take after you in honesty , indeed I do ," concluded the Englishman , looking full at Piedro , who took up his unsold basket of fish , looking somewhat silly , and gloomily walked off . Arthur , the English servant , was as good as his word . He dealt constantly with Francisco , and proved an excellent customer , buying from him during the whole season as much fruit as his master wanted . His master , who was an	s
Englishman of distinction , was invited to take up his residence , during his stay in Italy , at the Count de F .' s villa , which was in the environs of Naples -- an easy walk from Resina . Francisco had the pleasure of seeing his father ' s vineyard often full of generous visitors , and Arthur , who had circulated the anecdote of the bruised melon , was , he said , " proud to think that some of this was his doing , and that an Englishman never forgot a good turn , be it from a countryman or foreigner ." " My dear boy ," said Francisco ' s father to him , whilst Arthur was in the vineyard helping to tend the vines , " I am to thank you and your honesty , it seems , for our having our hands so full of business this season . It is fair you should have a share of our profits ." " So I have , father , enough and enough , when I see you and mother going on so well . What can I want more ?" " Oh , my	l
a severe beating . This beating did the boy no good ; it was vengeance not punishment . Piedro saw that his father was in a passion , and knew that he was beaten because he was found out to be a rogue , rather than for being one . He recollected perfectly that his father once said to him : " Let everyone take care of his own grapes ." Indeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had been educated to think that he might cheat every customer he could in the way of trade	s
; but it is too good for you . You must eat this , now , instead of gourds and figs -- and be thankful you have even this ." Piedro spent a whole winter very unhappily . He expected that all his old tricks , and especially what his father had said of him in the market - place , would be soon forgotten ; but month passed after month , and still these things were fresh in the memory of all who had known them . It is not easy to get rid of a bad character . A very great rogue * was once heard to say , that he would , with all his heart , give ten thousand pounds for a good character , because he knew that he could make twenty thousand by it . * Chartres . Something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he experienced the evils of a bad reputation , and when he saw the numerous advantages which Francisco ' s good character procured . Such had been Piedro ' s wretched education , that even the hard lessons of experience could not alter its pernicious	l
saw , cast a hungry eye upon one of the ripe figs . " But ," said Piedro , after he had taken several , " shall not I get you into a scrape by taking so many ? Won ' t your father be apt to miss them ?" " Do you think I would give them to you if they were not my own ?" said Francisco , with a sudden glance of indignation . " Well , don ' t be angry that I asked the question ; it was only from fear of getting you into disgrace that I asked it ." " It would not be easy for anybody to do that , I hope ," said Francisco , rather proudly . " And to me less than anybody ," replied Piedro , in an insinuating tone , " _I , _ that am so much obliged to you !" " A bunch of grapes , and a few figs , are no mighty obligation ," said Francisco , smiling ; " I wish I could do more for you . You seem , indeed , to have been very unhappy of late . We	l
any partnership with you at present ; but I will do what , perhaps , you will like as well ," said he , taking half the fruit out of his basket ; " you are heartily welcome to this ; try and sell it in the children ' s fruit market . I ' ll go on before you , and speak to those I am acquainted with , and tell them you are going to set up a new character , and that you hope to make it a good one ." " Hey , shall I ! Thank you for ever , dear Francisco ," cried Piedro , seizing his plentiful gift of fruit . " Say what you please for me ." " But don ' t make me say anything that is not true ," said Francisco , pausing . " No , to be sure not ," said Piedro ; " I DO mean to give no room for scandal . If I could get them to trust me as they do you , I should be happy indeed ." " That is what you may do , if you please ," said Francisco	l
in proportion to his credit , his opportunities of defrauding increased ; and these became temptations which he had not the firmness to resist . His old manner of thinking recurred . " I make but a few shillings a day , and this is but slow work ," said he to himself . " What signifies my good character , if I make so little by it ?" Light gains , and frequent , make a heavy purse , * was one of Francisco ' s proverbs . But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to	s
Why must the board tell a lie to - day ?" " It would ruin me to alter it ," said Piedro . " A lie may ruin you , but I could scarcely think the truth could ." " You have no right to meddle with me or my board ," said Piedro , put off his guard , and out of his usual soft voice of civility , by this last observation . " My character , and that of my board , are too firmly established now for any chance customer like you to injure ." "	s
I never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else ," said Carlo --" I wish , moreover , you may not injure yourself . Do as you please with your board , but give me my sugar - plums , for I have some right to meddle with those , having paid for them ." " Hold out your hand , then ." " No , put them in here , if you please ; put my sister ' s , at least , in here ; she likes to have them in this box : I bought some for her in it yesterday , and she ' ll think they ' ll taste the better out of the same box . But how is this ? your measure does not fill my box nearly ; you give us very few sugar - plums for our money ." " I give you full measure , as I give to everybody ." " The measure should be an inch cube , I know ," said Carlo ; " that ' s what all the little merchants have agreed to , you know ." " True ," said Piedro , " so	l
has a false bottom -- it holds only three - quarters as much as it ought to do ; and his numerous customers have all been cheated of one - quarter of every measure of the admirable sugar - plums they have bought from him . ' Think twice of a good bargain ,' says the proverb ." " So we have been finely duped , indeed ," cried some of the bystanders , looking at one another with a mortified air . " Full of courtesy , full of craft !" * " So this is the meaning of his burnt almonds gratis ," cried others ; all joined in an uproar of indignation , except one , who , as he stood behind the rest , expressed in his countenance silent surprise and sorrow . * Chi et FA pi caress che non vole , O ingannato t ' ha , o inganuar et vole . " Is this Piedro a relation of yours ?" said Carlo , going up to this silent person . " I am sorry , if he be , that I have published his disgrace , for I would not hurt YOU .	l
- boat myself . You may guess I should have been sorry enough to have lost it . Thank you for its being once more in my careless hands , and tell me , I beg , whenever I can do you any service . By - the - by , I can make up for you a fruit stall . I ' ll do it to - morrow , and it shall be the admiration of the market . Is there anything else you could think of for me ?" " Why , yes ," said Francisco ; "	s
since you are so good - natured , perhaps you ' d be kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures that I see upon your rule . I have a great curiosity to know their use ." " That I ' ll explain to you with pleasure , as far as I know them myself ; but when I ' m at fault , my father , who is cleverer than I am , and understands trigonometry , can help us out ." " Trigonometry !" repeated Francisco , not a little alarmed at the high sounding word ; " that ' s what I certainly shall never understand ." " Oh , never fear ," replied Carlo , laughing . " I looked just as you do now - - I felt just as you do now -- all in a fright and a puzzle , when I first heard of angles and sines , and cosines , and arcs and centres , and complements and tangents ." " Oh mercy ! mercy !" interrupted Francisco , whilst Carlo laughed , with a benevolent sense of superiority . " Why ," said	l
her brother , looking at a heap of shells , which she held before her in her frock . " Yes , partly ," said Rosetta . " It was partly my own fault , but not all . You know I went out to the carpenter ' s yard , near the arsenal , where all the children are picking up chips and sticks so busily ; and I was as busy as any of them , because I wanted to fill my basket soon ; and then I thought I should sell my basketful directly in the little wood - market . As soon as I had filled my basket , and made up my faggot ( which was not done , brother , till I was almost baked by the sun , for I was forced to wait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggot )-- I say , when it was all ready , and my basket full , I left it altogether in the yard ." " That was not wise to leave it ," said Carlo . " But I only left it for a few minutes ,	l
brother , and I could not think anybody would be so dishonest as to take it whilst I was away . I only just ran to tell a boy , who had picked up all these beautiful shells upon the sea - shore , and who wanted to sell them , that I should be glad to buy them from him , if he would only be so good as to keep them for me , for an hour or so , till I had carried my wood to market , and till I had sold it , and so	s
in the yard of the arsenal . It was found to fit exactly . The judge then found it impossible to restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators . The prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market ; and the moment sentence was pronounced , Piedro was hissed and hooted out of the market - place . Thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of earning his bread . We shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades he next attempted . He handed lemonade about in a part of Naples where he was not known , but he lost his customers by putting too much water and too little lemon into this beverage . He then took to the waters from the sulphurous springs , and served them about to foreigners ; but one day , as he was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door , he slipped his foot , and broke his glasses . They had been borrowed from an old woman , who hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade . Piedro knew that it was the custom	l
And the times are changed since I set about to explain this rule of mine to you ." " Ay , that rule ," said Francisco --" how much I owe to it ! Some great people , when they lose any of their fine things , cause the crier to promise a reward of so much money to anyone who shall find and restore their trinket . How richly have you and your father rewarded me for returning this rule !" Francisco ' s modesty and gratitude , as they were perfectly sincere , attached his friends to him most powerfully ; but there was one person who regretted our hero ' s frequent absences from his vineyard at Resina . Not Francisco ' s father , for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his business ; and as to the hours spent in Naples , he had so much confidence in Francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his getting into bad company . When his son had once said to him , " I spend my time at such a place , and in such and such a manner ," he was as well convinced	l
, and what slight instructions he had received . Arthur was desired to summon the young artist . Francisco ' s honest , open manner , joined to the proofs he had given of his abilities , and the character Arthur gave him for strict honesty , and constant kindness to his parents , interested Mr . Lee , the name of this English gentleman , much in his favour . Mr . Lee was at this time in treaty with an Italian painter , whom he wished to engage to copy for him exactly some of the cornices , mouldings , tablets , and antique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient city of Herculaneum . * * We must give those of our young English readers who may not be acquainted with the ancient city of Herculaneum , some idea of it . None can be ignorant that near Naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of Vesuvius ;-- that , from time to time , there happen violent eruptions from this mountain ; that is to say , flames and immense clouds of smoke issue from different openings , mouths , or CRATERS	l
, that I have reserved for him out of my own share ." " Add this fine pine - apple for my share , then ," said his father , " and a pleasant walk to you , my young friends ." They proceeded gaily along , and when they reached Naples , as they passed through the square where the little merchants held their market , Francisco pointed to the spot where he found Carlo ' s rule . He never missed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their former kindness to him .	s
going to commence another . He fixed his eyes upon Francisco , then glanced at Carlo and Rosetta , and after a moment ' s consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that our young English readers may , perhaps , know by the name of " Cornaro , or the Grateful Turk ." Francisco was deeply interested in this narrative , and when the hat was dropped , he eagerly threw in his contribution . At the end of the story , when the speaker ' s voice stopped , there was a momentary silence , which was broken by the orator himself , who exclaimed , as he took up the hat which lay at his feet , " My friends , here is some mistake ! this is not my hat ; it has been changed whilst I was taken up with my story . Pray , gentlemen , find my hat amongst you ; it was a remarkably good one , a present from a nobleman for an epigram I made . I would not lose my hat for twice its value . It has my name written withinside of it ,	l
father ' s garden , it was my luck to come to an old Roman vessel full of gold . I have this day agreed for a house in Naples for my father . We shall live , whilst we can afford it , like great folks , you will see ; and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my old friends , the little Neapolitan merchants , who will change their note when they see my change of fortune . What say you to all this , Francisco the Honest ?" " That	s
lady was taken out of it , and was hurried by her attendants into a shop , where she stayed till her carriage was set to rights . She was too much alarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of anything ; but after some time , she perceived that she had lost a valuable diamond cross , which she had worn that night at the opera . She was uncertain where she had dropped it ; the shop , the carriage , the street , were searched for it in vain . Piedro saw it	s
fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage , seized upon it , and carried it off . Ignorant as he was of the full value of what he had stolen , he knew not how to satisfy himself as to this point , without trusting someone with the secret . After some hesitation , he determined to apply to a Jew , who , as it was whispered , was ready to buy everything that was offered to him for sale , without making any TROUBLESOME inquiries . It was late ; he waited till the streets were cleared , and then knocked softly at the back door of the Jew ' s house . The person who opened the door for Piedro was his own father . Piedro started back ; but his father had fast hold of him . " What brings you here ?" said the father , in a low voice , a voice which expressed fear and rage mixed . " Only to ask my way -- my shortest way ," stammered Piedro . " No equivocations ! Tell me what brings you here at this time of the night ? I	l
those patrons who think that they have done enough when they have given five guineas . His servant Arthur always considered every generous action of his master ' s as his own , and was particularly pleased whenever this generosity was directed towards Francisco . As for Carlo and the little Rosetta , they were the companions of all the pleasant walks which Francisco used to take in the cool of the evening , after he had been shut up all day at his work . And the old carpenter , delighted with the gratitude of his pupil , frequently repeated --" that he was proud to have given the first instructions to such a GENIUS ; and that he had always prophesied Francisco would be a GREAT man ." " And a good man , papa ," said Rosetta ; " for though he has grown so great , and though he goes into palaces now , to say nothing of that place underground , where he has leave to go , yet , notwithstanding all this , he never forgets my brother Carlo and you ." " That ' s the way to have good friends ," said	l
the " Philosophical Transactions ." It is sufficient here to say that , in the space of about five hours , the wretched inhabitants of Torre del Greco saw their town utterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the mountain . The villa of Count de Flora , with some others , which were at a little distance from the town , escaped ; but they were absolutely surrounded by the lava . The count and countess were obliged to fly from their house with the utmost precipitation in the night - time ; and they	s

" Bravo ! bravissimo !"-- Francisco thought he knew the voice and the countenance of this man , who exclaimed with so much enthusiasm . He remembered to have seen him before , but when , or where , he could not recollect . As soon as the count left the hall , the stranger came up to Francisco . " Is it possible ," said he , " that you don ' t know me ? It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I drew tears from your eyes ." " Tears from my eyes ?" repeated Francisco , smiling ; " I have shed but few tears . I have had but few misfortunes in my life ." The stranger answered him by two extempore Italian lines , which conveyed nearly the same idea that has been so well expressed by an English poet :-- " To each their sufferings -- all are men Condemn ' d alike to	l
he recited his verses to a great crowd of people in one of the public squares . Amongst the crowd were several to whom the name of Francisco was well known , and by whom he was well beloved . These were his young companions , who remembered him as a fruit - seller amongst the little merchants . They rejoiced to hear his praises , and repeated the lines with shouts of applause . " Let us pass . What is all this disturbance in the streets ?" said a man , pushing his way through the crowd .	s
SIGNOR Francisco I may , without impropriety , call him ," said the Improvisatore , " for he is likely to become rich enough to command the title from those who might not otherwise respect his merit ." " Likely to become rich ! how ?" said the lad , whom our readers have probably before this time discovered to be Piedro . " How , pray , is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor ?" " The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine furniture , plate and jewels	s

Did I understand rightly what he said about poniards ? Francisco ; oh , Francisco ! Excellent , kind , generous Francisco !

Jew to whom he , several months before , sold the diamond cross . That cross which he thought himself so lucky to have stolen , and to have disposed of undetected , was , in fact , the cause of his being in his present dreadful situation . It was at the Jew ' s that he connected himself with this gang of robbers , to whom he was now become an absolute slave . " Oh , that I dared to disobey !" said he to himself , with a deep sigh , as he knocked softly at	s
the back door of the Jew ' s house . The back door opened into a narrow , unfrequented street , and some small rooms at this side of the house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired to have their business kept secret . These rooms were separated by a dark passage from the rest of the house , and numbers of people came to the shop in the front of the house , which looked into a creditable street , without knowing anything more , from the ostensible appearance of the shop , than that it was a kind of pawnbroker ' s , where old clothes , old iron , and all sorts of refuse goods , might be disposed of conveniently . At the moment Piedro knocked at the back door , the front shop was full of customers ; and the Jew ' s boy , whose office it was to attend to these signals , let Piedro in , told him that none of his comrades were yet come , and left him in a room by himself . He was pale and trembling , and felt a cold dew spread	l

Delightful task ! to rear the tender thought ,-- To teach the young idea how to shoot ,-- To pour the fresh instruction o ' er the mind ,-- To breathe th ' enlivening spirit ,-- and to fix The generous purpose in the glowing breast . THOMSON . Young Hardy was educated by Mr . Freeman , a very excellent master , at one of our rural Sunday schools . He was honest , obedient , active and good - natured , hence he was esteemed by his master ; and being beloved by all his companions who were good , he did not desire to be loved by the bad ; nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle , mischievous or dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him . His friend Loveit , on the contrary , wished to be universally liked , and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the school -- and so he	l
forefinger . " Look at him !-- now do look at him !" cried Tarlton ; " did you ever in your life see anybody look so silly ?-- Hardy has him quite under his thumb ; he ' s so mortally afraid of Parson Prig , that he dare not , for the soul of him , turn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose ; look how he squints !" " I don ' t squint ," said Loveit , looking up , " and nobody has me under his thumb ! and what Hardy	s
door in the cottage open , and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home . This , however , he could by no means persuade them to do , until they had filled their pockets with apples ; then , to his great joy , they returned , crept in at the window and each retired , as softly as possible , to his own apartment . Loveit slept in the room with Hardy , whom he had left fast asleep , and whom he now was extremely afraid of awakening . All the apples were emptied out of Loveit ' s pockets , and lodged with Tarlton till the morning , for fear the smell should betray the secret to Hardy . The room door was apt to creak , but it was opened with such precaution , that no noise could be heard , and Loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him . " Ah ," said he to himself , " how quietly he sleeps ! I wish I had been sleeping too ." The reproaches of Loveit ' s conscience , however , served no other purpose but to	l
was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the booty . Everyone was astonished that Hardy , with all his quickness and penetration , had not yet discovered their proceedings ; but Loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be . Loveit had strictly kept his promise of secrecy ; but he was by no means an artful boy ; and in talking to his friend , conscious that he had something to conceal , he was perpetually on the point of betraying himself ; then recollecting his engagement , he blushed , stammered , bungled ; and upon Hardy ' s asking what he meant , would answer with a silly , guilty countenance , that he did not know ; or abruptly break off , saying , " Oh nothing ! nothing at all !" It was in vain that he urged Tarlton to permit him to consult his friend . A gloom overspread Tarlton ' s brow when he began to speak on the subject , and he always returned a peremptory refusal , accompanied with some such taunting expression as this --" I wish we had nothing to	l
to himself , " they will certainly be flogged , and that I should be sorry for : yet they must not be let to go on stealing ; that would be worse still , for it would surely bring them to the gallows in the end . Let me see -- oh , ay , that will do ; I will borrow farmer Kent ' s dog Barker , he ' ll keep them off , I ' ll answer for it ." Farmer Kent lent his dog Barker , cautioning his neighbour , at the same time , to be sure to chain him well , for he was the fiercest mastiff in England . The old man , with farmer Kent ' s assistance , chained him fast to the trunk of the apple - tree . Night came ; and Tarlton , Loveit and his companions , returned at the usual hour . Grown bolder now by frequent success , they came on talking and laughing . But the moment they had set their foot in the garden , the dog started up ; and , shaking the chain as he sprang forward , barked with	l
precipitation . " Help me ! oh , pray , help me ! I can ' t get through the hedge ," cried Loveit , in a lamentable tone , whilst the dog growled hideously , and sprang forward to the extremity of his chain . " I can ' t get out ! Oh , for God ' s sake , stay for me one minute , dear Tarlton !" He called in vain ; he was left to struggle through his difficulties by himself ; and of all his dear friends not one turned back to help him . At last , torn and terrified , he got through the hedge and ran home , despising his companions for their selfishness . Nor could he help observing that Tarlton , with all his vaunted prowess , was the first to run away from the appearance of danger . The next morning Loveit could not help reproaching the party with their conduct . " Why could not you , any of you , stay one minute to help me ?" said he . " We did not hear you call ," answered one . " I was so frightened	l
to be duped . " How strange it is ," thought he , " that I should set such value upon the love of those I despise ! When I ' m once out of this scrape , I ' ll have no more to do with them , I ' m determined ." Compared with his friend Hardy , his new associates did indeed appear contemptible ; for all this time Hardy had treated him with uniform kindness , avoided to pry into his secrets , yet seemed ready to receive his confidence , if it had been offered	s
well ?" " You know the dog that frightened us last night ?" " Yes ." " It will never frighten us again ." " Won ' t it ? how so ?" " Look here ," said Tarlton , drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a blue handkerchief . " What ' s that ?" Tarlton opened it . " Raw meat !" exclaimed Loveit . " How came you by it ?" " Tom , the servant boy , Tom got it for me ; and I ' m to give him sixpence ." " And is it for the dog ?" " Yes ; I vowed I ' d be revenged on him , and after this he ' ll never bark again ." " Never bark again ! What do you mean ? Is it poison ?" exclaimed Loveit , starting back with horror . " Only poison for A DOG ," said Tarlton , confused ; " you could not look more shocking if it was poison for a Christian ." Loveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence . " Tarlton ," said he at last , in a changed tone and	l
eye at defiance . " What do you mean to do to - night ?" " To go to sleep , as you do , I suppose ," replied Tarlton , turning away abruptly , and whistling as he walked off . " Oh , he has certainly changed his mind !" said Loveit to himself , " else he could not whistle ." About ten minutes after this , as he and Hardy were undressing , Hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass . " Oh ," said he , " it will be quite spoiled before morning !" " Call Tom ," said Loveit , " and bid him bring it in for you in a minute ." They both went to the top of the stairs to call Tom ; no one answered . They called again louder , " Is Tom below ?" " I ' m here ," answered he at last , coming out of Tarlton ' s room with a look of mixed embarrassment and effrontery . And as he was receiving Hardy ' s commission , Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging	l
, seized hold of him , dragged him down , detaining him with a firm grasp , whilst he panted for utterance . " What , Master Hardy , is it you ? what ' s the matter ? what do you want ?" " I want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket ." " Who told you that I had any such thing ?" said Tom , clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket . " Give it me quietly , and I ' ll let you off ." " Sir , upon my word I haven ' t ! I didn ' t ! I don ' t know what you mean ," said Tom , trembling , though he was by far the stronger of the two . " Indeed , I don ' t know what you mean ." " You do ," said Hardy , with great indignation : and a violent struggle immediately commenced . The dog , now alarmed by the voices , began to bark outrageously . Tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter ; his strength forsook him ,	l
have nothing to confess ; I am innocent ; but if I were not , I would never try to get off myself by betraying my companions ." " Very well , sir ! very well ! very fine ! stick to it , stick to it , I advise you , and we shall see . And how will you look to - morrow , Mr . Innocent , when my uncle , the doctor , comes home ?" " As I do now , sir ," said Hardy , unmoved . His composure threw Mr . Power into	s
master thought proper . " Oh , they have been punished enough ," said the old man ; " forgive them , sir ." Hardy looked as if he wished to speak . " Not because you ask it ," said Mr . Trueman to the guilty penitents , " though I should be glad to oblige you -- it wouldn ' t be just ; but there ," pointing to Hardy , " there is one who has merited a reward ; the highest I can give him is that of pardoning his companions ." Hardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure , whilst everybody present sympathized in his feelings . " I am sure ," thought Loveit , " this is a lesson I shall never forget ." " Gentlemen ," said the old man , with a faltering voice , " it wasn ' t for the sake of my apples that I spoke ; and you , sir ," said he to Hardy , " I thank you for saving my dog . If you please , I ' ll plant on that mount , opposite the window , a young apple - tree ,	l
stones behind the carriage wheels to prevent them from rolling backwards down the steep , slippery hill . * " Their whole study was how to please and to help one another ." ** This was about the close of the 18th century . The little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old woman ' s spinning - wheel when she was spinning , and to talk to her . At these times she taught them something , which , she said , she hoped they would remember all their lives . She explained to them	s
what is meant by telling the truth , and what it is to be honest . She taught them to dislike idleness , and to wish that they could be useful . One evening , as they were standing beside her , the little boy said to her , " Grandmother ," for that was the name by which she liked that these children should call her --" grandmother , how often you are forced to get up from your spinning - wheel , and to follow the chaises and coaches up that steep hill , to put stones underneath the wheels , to hinder them from rolling back ! The people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this , don ' t they ?" " Yes , child ." " But it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill . You often say that you are tired , and then you know that you cannot spin all that time . Now if we might go up the hill , and put the stones behind the wheels , you could sit still at your work ,	l
they used to call her , up the steep hill ; and she showed the boy how to prevent the wheels from rolling back , by putting stones behind them ; and she said , " This is called scotching the wheels ;" and she took off the boy ' s hat and gave it to the little girl , to hold up to the carriage - windows , ready for the halfpence . When she thought that the children knew how to manage by themselves , she left them , and returned to her spinning - wheel . A great many carriages happened to go by this day , and the little girl received a great many halfpence . She carried them all in her brother ' s hat to her grandmother in the evening ; and the old woman smiled , and thanked the children . She said that they had been useful to her , and that her spinning had gone on finely , because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day . " But , Paul my boy ," said she , " what is the matter with your hand ?"	l
it of some use , if I may have it ." " Take it then , dear ," said the old woman ; " and you ' ll find the handle of the broken crutch under my bed ." Paul went to work immediately , and fastened one end of the pole into the block of wood , so as to make something like a dry - rubbing brush . " Look , grandmamma , look at my SCOTCHER . I call this thing my SCOTCHER ," said Paul , " because I shall always scotch the wheels with it . I shall never pinch my fingers again ; my hands , you see , will be safe at the end of this long stick ; and , sister Anne , you need not be at the trouble of carrying any more stones after me up the hill ; we shall never want stones any more . My scotcher will do without anything else , I hope . I wish it was morning , and that a carriage would come , that I might run up the hill , and try my scotcher ." " And I wish that as	l
chaises ; no more chaises will come to - night ; and your scotcher is lying there , of no use , upon the ground . Have not I waited long enough for to - day , Paul ?" " Oh , no ," said Paul ; " here are some blackberries for you ; you had better wait a little bit longer . Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are standing here talking to me ." Anne , who was of a very obliging temper , and who liked to do what she was asked to do	s
stock still listening my best ." Prepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be understood , Anne looked very grave , and her brother explained to her , that , with a guinea , she might buy two hundred and fifty - two times as many plums as she could get for a penny . " Why , Paul , you know the fruit - woman said she would give us a dozen plums for a penny . Now , for this little guinea , would she give us two hundred and fifty - two dozen ?"	s
into the hat , and I daresay he gave us the guinea along with them because he liked your scotcher so much ." " Why ," said Paul , " that might be , to be sure , but I wish I was quite certain of it ." " Then , as we are not quite certain , had not we best go and ask my grandmother what she thinks about it ?" Paul thought this was excellent advice ; and he was not a silly boy , who did not like to follow good advice . He went with	s
his sister directly to his grandmother , showed her the guinea , and told her how they came by it . " My dear , honest children ," said she , " I am very glad you told me all this . I am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the blanket with this guinea . I ' m sure it is not honestly ours . Those who threw it you gave it you by mistake , I warrant ; and what I would have you do is , to go to Dunstable , and try if you can , at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you . It is now so late in the evening that perhaps the travellers will sleep at Dunstable , instead of going on the next stage ; and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of a halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time . All you can do is to go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise ." " Oh !" interrupted Paul , " I know a good way of	l
for you , and get you called in afore the children are sent to bed ." The landlady , after the usual speech of , " I hope the supper and everything is to your liking , ladies and gentlemen ," began with , " If any of the young gentlemen or ladies would have a CUR ' OSITY to see any of our famous Dunstable straw - work , there ' s a decent body without would , I daresay , be proud to show them her pincushion - boxes , and her baskets and slippers , and her other CUR ' OSITIES ." The eyes of the children all turned towards their mother ; their mother smiled , and immediately their father called in the basket - woman , and desired her to produce her CURIOSITIES . The children gathered round her large pannier as it opened , but they did not touch any of her things . " Ah , papa !" cried a little rosy girl , " here are a pair of straw slippers that would just fit you , I think ; but would not straw shoes wear out very soon ? and would	l
not they let in the wet ?" " Yes , my dear ," said her father , " but these slippers are meant --" " For powdering - slippers , miss ," interrupted the basket - woman . " To wear when people are powdering their hair ," continued the gentleman , " that they may not spoil their other shoes ." " And will you buy them , papa ?" " No , I cannot indulge myself ," said her father , " in buying them now . I must make amends ," said he , laughing , "	s
for my carelessness ; and as I threw away a guinea to - day , I must endeavour to save sixpence at least ?" " Ah , the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girl ' s hat as we were coming up Chalk Hill . Mamma , I wonder that the little girl did not take notice of its being a guinea , and that she did not run after the chaise to give it back again . I should think , if she had been an honest girl , she would have returned it ." " Miss !-- ma ' am !-- sir !" said the basket - woman , " if it would not be impertinent , may I speak a word ? A little boy and girl have just been here inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a halfpenny by mistake ; and not five minutes ago I saw the boy give the guinea to a gentleman ' s servant , who is there without , and who said his master desired it should be returned to him ." " There must be some mistake , or some	l
should be honest -- so she has ; and I wish she had a new blanket before next winter , to keep her from the cold and the rheumatism . She had the rheumatism sadly last winter , sir ; and there is a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her ." " She shall have it , then ; and ," continued the gentleman , " I will do something more for you . Do you like to be employed or to be idle best ?" " We like to have something to do	s

Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert , try this experiment , if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor . Yes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever . But here is an artist . He desires to paint you the dreamiest , shadiest , quietest , most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco . What is the chief element he employs ? There stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a hermit and a crucifix were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke . Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way , reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill - side blue . But though the picture lies thus tranced , and though this pine - tree	l

But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the Fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way --	s
Manhatto , I duly arrived in New Bedford . It was a Saturday night in December . Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following Monday . As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that I , for one , had no idea of so doing . For my mind was made up to	s
eat and sleep meanwhile . It was a very dubious - looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless . I knew no one in the place . With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver ,-- So , wherever you go , Ishmael , said I to myself , as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you	s
But it is a common name in Nantucket , they say , and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there . As the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty - stricken sort of creak to it , I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee . It was a queer sort of place -- a gable - ended old house , one side palsied as it were , and leaning over sadly . It stood on a sharp bleak corner , where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul ' s tossed craft . Euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in - doors , with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed . " In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon ," says an old writer	l
is the house . What a pity they didn ' t stop up the chinks and the crannies though , and thrust in a little lint here and there . But it ' s too late to make any improvements now . The universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago . Poor Lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn - cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon . Euroclydon ! says old Dives , in his red silken wrapper --( he had a redder one afterwards ) pooh , pooh ! What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; what northern lights ! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals . But what thinks Lazarus ? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?	l
and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans . But no more of this blubbering now , we are going a - whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come . Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet , and see what sort of a place this " Spouter " may be . CHAPTER 3 The Spouter - Inn . Entering that gable - ended Spouter - Inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old - fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft . On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose . Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the New England	l
wide world ' s remotest nooks . Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark - looking den -- the bar -- a rude attempt at a right whale ' s head . Be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale ' s jaw , so wide , a coach might almost drive beneath it . Within are shabby shelves , ranged round with old decanters , bottles , flasks ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed Jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ), bustles a little withered old man , who , for their money , dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death . Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison . Though true cylinders without -- within , the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom . Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass , surround these footpads ' goblets . Fill to THIS mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to THIS a penny more ; and so on to the full glass -- the Cape Horn measure ,	l
which you may gulp down for a shilling . Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER . I sought the landlord , and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room , received for answer that his house was full -- not a bed unoccupied . " But avast ," he added , tapping his forehead , " you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer ' s blanket , have ye ? I s ' pose you are goin	s
! dumplings for supper ! One young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner . " My boy ," said the landlord , " you ' ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty ." " Landlord ," I whispered , " that aint the harpooneer is it ?" " Oh , no ," said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , " the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap . He never eats dumplings , he don ' t -- he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes ' em rare ." " The devil he does ," says I . " Where is that harpooneer ? Is he here ?" " He ' ll be here afore long ," was the answer . I could not help it , but I began to feel suspicious of this " dark complexioned " harpooneer . At any rate , I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must undress and get into bed before I did . Supper over , the company went back to the bar	l
then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in . But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night	s
' lar ," was the rejoinder . " But come , it ' s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes -- it ' s a nice bed ; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced . There ' s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it ' s an almighty big bed that . Why , afore we give it up , Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it . But I got a dreaming and sprawling	s
table ; " there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye ." I turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared . Folding back the counterpane , I stooped over the bed . Though none of the most elegant , it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well . I then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale .	s
way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room . I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag ' s mouth . This accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens ! what a sight ! Such a face ! It was of a dark , purplish , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares . Yes , it ' s just as I thought , he ' s a terrible bedfellow ; he ' s been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon . But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that I plainly saw they could not be sticking - plasters at all , those black squares on his cheeks . They were stains of some sort or other . At first I knew not what to make of this ;	l
loving and affectionate manner . You had almost thought I had been his wife . The counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti - coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , I say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt . Indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke , I could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me . My sensations were strange . Let me try to explain them . When I was a child , I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , I	l
s pagan arm thrown round me . But at length all the past night ' s events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament . For though I tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain . I now strove to rouse him --" Queequeg !"-- but his only answer was a snore . I then rolled over , my neck	s
Queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands . He then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash - stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face . I was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up	s
third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns . You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore . This young fellow ' s healthy cheek is like a sun - toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage . That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him . In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore . But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ? which , barred with various tints , seemed like the Andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone . " Grub , ho !" now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we	l
warrior whalemen ! But as for Queequeg -- why , Queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle . To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding . His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him . But THAT was certainly very coolly done by	s
, in the Apollo Green , live Yankees have often scared the natives . But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping . In these last - mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in New Bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh . It makes a stranger stare . But , besides the Feegeeans , Tongatobooarrs , Erromanggoans , Pannangians , and Brighggians , and , besides the wild specimens of the whaling - craft which unheeded reel about the streets	s
stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste . Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man - ropes , Father Mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor - like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main - top of his vessel . The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually	s
connexions ? Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a self - containing stronghold -- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls . But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain ' s former sea - farings . Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant	s
meaning ?-- for the pulpit is ever this earth ' s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world . From thence it is the storm of God ' s quick wrath is first descried , and the bow must bear the earliest brunt . From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds . Yes , the world ' s a ship on its passage out , and not a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow . CHAPTER 9 The	s
awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah . As with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God -- never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command . But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade . And if we obey God , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying God consists . " With this sin of disobedience in him , Jonah still further flouts at God , by seeking to flee from Him . He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign , but only the Captains of this earth . He skulks about the wharves of Joppa , and seeks a ship that ' s bound for Tarshish . There lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded	l
westward from that , just outside the Straits of Gibraltar . See ye not then , shipmates , that Jonah sought to flee world - wide from God ? Miserable man ! Oh ! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , skulking from his God ; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas . So disordered , self - condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , Jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck . How plainly he ' s a fugitive ! no baggage , not a hat - box , valise , or carpet - bag ,-- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux . At last , after much dodging search , he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger ' s evil eye . Jonah sees	l
bear the wicked burden . A dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break . But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah ' s head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep . He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds	s
he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him . Aye , shipmates , Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship -- a berth in the cabin as I have taken it , and was fast asleep . But the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ' What meanest thou , O , sleeper ! arise !' Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , Jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea . But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks . Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat . And ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead , aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep . "	l
Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul . In all his cringing attitudes , the God - fugitive is now too plainly known . The sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by referring the whole matter to high Heaven , they fall to casting lots , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them . The lot is Jonah ' s ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions . ' What is	s
that , shipmates ? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood ! That was it ! " This , shipmates , this is that other lesson ; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it . Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty ! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale ! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal ! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness ! Woe to	s
looked more expansive than it otherwise would , this I will not venture to decide ; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one . It may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of General Washington ' s head , as seen in the popular busts of him . It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows , which were likewise very projecting , like two long promontories thickly wooded on top . Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed . Whilst I was thus closely scanning him , half - pretending	s
little complimented . We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it . Thus I soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town . Soon I proposed a social smoke ; and , producing his pouch and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff . And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us . If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan ' s breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon thawed it out , and left us cronies . He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , clasped me round the waist , and said that henceforth we were married ; meaning , in his country ' s phrase , that we	l
spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine . I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ' pockets . I let them stay . He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper fireboard . By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise . I was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church . How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ? But what is worship ? thought I . Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ? Impossible ! But what is worship ?-- to do the will	l
if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part . Upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self - created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve - o ' clock - at - night , I experienced a disagreeable revulsion . Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk . Be it said , that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them . For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then . I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord ' s policy of insurance . I was only alive	l
to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend . With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new - lit lamp . Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , I know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , I begged	s
, I fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth . A Sag Harbor ship visited his father ' s bay , and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands . But the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the King his father ' s influence could prevail . But Queequeg vowed a vow . Alone in his canoe , he paddled off to a distant strait , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island . On one side was	s
house . Not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- Queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf . " Why ," said I , " Queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think . Didn ' t the people laugh ?" Upon this , he told me another story . The people of his island of Rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held . Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko , and its commander -- from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain -- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg ' s sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten . Well ; when all the wedding guests	l
were assembled at the bride ' s bamboo cottage , this Captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honour , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the High Priest and his majesty the King , Queequeg ' s father . Grace being said ,-- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though Queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts -- Grace	s
silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye . Such is the endlessness , yea , the intolerableness of all earthly effort . Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ;	s
! Take out your map and look at it . See what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse . Look at it -- a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background . There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper . Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they don ' t grow naturally ; that they import	s
, goes down to it in ships ; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation . THERE is his home ; THERE lies his business , which a Noah ' s flood would not interrupt , though it overwhelmed all the millions in China . He lives on the sea , as prairie cocks in the prairie ; he hides among the waves , he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps . For years he knows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last , it smells like another world , more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman . With the landless gull , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at nightfall , the Nantucketer , out of sight of land , furls his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales . CHAPTER 15 Chowder . It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor , and Queequeg and I went ashore ; so we could attend to no business	l
given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard , and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard , and that done , then ask the first man we met where the place was : these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first , especially as , at the outset , Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse -- our first point of departure -- must be left on the larboard hand , whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard . However , by dint of beating about a little in the dark , and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way , we at last came to something which there was no mistaking . Two enormous wooden pots painted black , and suspended by asses ' ears , swung from the cross - trees of an old top - mast , planted in front of an old doorway . The horns of the cross - trees were sawed off on the other side , so	l
' nt v ' y ' ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of ILE , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night . So , Mr . Queequeg " ( for she had learned his name ), " I will just take this here iron , and keep it for you till morning . But the chowder ; clam or cod to - morrow for breakfast , men ?" " Both ," says I ; " and let ' s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety ." CHAPTER 16 The Ship . In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow . But to my surprise and no small concern , Queequeg now gave me to understand , that he had been diligently consulting Yojo -- the name of his black little god -- and Yojo had told him two or three times over , and strongly insisted upon it everyway , that instead of our going together	l
present irrespective of Queequeg . I have forgotten to mention that , in many things , Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo ' s judgment and surprising forecast of things ; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem , as a rather good sort of god , who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole , but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs . Now , this plan of Queequeg ' s , or rather Yojo ' s , touching the selection of our craft ; I did not like that plan at all . I had not a little relied upon Queequeg ' s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely . But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg , I was obliged to acquiesce ; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor , that should quickly settle that trifling little affair . Next morning early , leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom -- for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan , or	l
- dam , the Tit - bit , and the Pequod . DEVIL - DAM , I do not know the origin of ; TIT - BIT is obvious ; PEQUOD , you will no doubt remember , was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians ; now extinct as the ancient Medes . I peered and pryed about the Devil - dam ; from her , hopped over to the Tit - bit ; and finally , going on board the Pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us . You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day , for aught I know ;-- square - toed luggers ; mountainous Japanese junks ; butter - box galliots , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod . She was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old - fashioned claw - footed look about her . Long seasoned and weather - stained in the typhoons and calms of	l
aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship ' s work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command . He was seated on an old - fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed . There was nothing so very particular , perhaps , about the appearance of the elderly man I saw ; he was brown and brawny , like most old	s
what I said about the marchant service -- don ' t aggravate me -- I won ' t have it . But let us understand each other . I have given thee a hint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ?" " I do , sir ." " Very good . Now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale ' s throat , and then jump after it ? Answer , quick !" " I am , sir , if it should be positively indispensable to do so	s
in good interest . Now , Bildad , like Peleg , and indeed many other Nantucketers , was a Quaker , the island having been originally settled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker , only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous . For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale - hunters . They are fighting Quakers ; they are Quakers with a vengeance . So that there are instances among them of	s
his days , the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence , I do not know ; but it did not seem to concern him much , and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man ' s religion is one thing , and this practical world quite another . This world pays dividends . Rising from a little cabin - boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab , to a harpooneer in a broad shad - bellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat - header , chief - mate	s
?" " Thou knowest best ," was the sepulchral reply , " the seven hundred and seventy - seventh wouldn ' t be too much , would it ?--' where moth and rust do corrupt , but LAY --'" LAY , indeed , thought I , and such a lay ! the seven hundred and seventy - seventh ! Well , old Bildad , you are determined that I , for one , shall not LAY up many LAYS here below , where moth and rust do corrupt . It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that , indeed ; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman , yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy - seven is a pretty large number , yet , when you come to make a TEENTH of it , you will then see , I say , that the seven hundred and seventy - seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy - seven gold doubloons ; and so I thought at the time . " Why , blast your eyes , Bildad ," cried	l
Peleg , " thou dost not want to swindle this young man ! he must have more than that ." " Seven hundred and seventy - seventh ," again said Bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling --" for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also ." " I am going to put him down for the three hundredth ," said Peleg , " do ye hear that , Bildad ! The three hundredth lay , I say ." Bildad laid down his book , and turning solemnly towards him said	s
- coloured son of a wooden gun -- a straight wake with ye !" As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad , but with a marvellous oblique , sliding celerity , Bildad for that time eluded him . Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship , and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded , I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad , who , I made no doubt , was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg . But to my astonishment , he sat down again on the transom very quietly , and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing . He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways . As for Peleg , after letting off his rage as he had , there seemed no more left in him , and he , too , sat down like a lamb , though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated . " Whew !" he whistled at last --"	l
her crew on board , ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged , and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief , that if the captain have a family , or any absorbing concernment of that sort , he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port , but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea . However , it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands . Turning back I	s
slipped my mind . CHAPTER 17 The Ramadan . As Queequeg ' s Ramadan , or Fasting and Humiliation , was to continue all day , I did not choose to disturb him till towards night - fall ; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody ' s religious obligations , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad - stool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets , bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name . I say , we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their half - crazy conceits on these subjects . There was Queequeg , now , certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan ;-- but what of that ? Queequeg thought he knew what he was about , I	l
her to understand the whole case . Unconsciously clapping the vinegar - cruet to one side of her nose , she ruminated for an instant ; then exclaimed --" No ! I haven ' t seen it since I put it there ." Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs , she glanced in , and returning , told me that Queequeg ' s harpoon was missing . " He ' s killed himself ," she cried . " It ' s unfort ' nate Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane -- God pity his poor mother !-- it will be the ruin of my house . Has the poor lad a sister ? Where ' s that girl ?-- there , Betty , go to Snarles the Painter , and tell him to paint me a sign , with --" no suicides permitted here , and no smoking in the parlor ;"-- might as well kill both birds at once . Kill ? The Lord be merciful to his ghost ! What ' s that noise there ? You , young man , avast there !" And running up after me , she	l
, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain . There he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way . I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island . It must be so ; yes , it ' s part of his creed , I suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he ' ll get up sooner or later , no doubt . It can ' t last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I don ' t believe it ' s very punctual then . I went down to supper . After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum - pudding voyage , as they called it ( that is	l
, a short whaling - voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the Atlantic Ocean only ); after listening to these plum - puddingers till nearly eleven o ' clock , I went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination . But no ; there he was just where I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch . I began to grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright senseless and	s
stark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; opposed , in short , to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense . I told him , too , that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage , it pained me , very badly pained me , to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his . Besides , argued I , fasting makes the body cave in ; hence the spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half	s
tell , now ," cried Bildad , " is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy ' s meeting ? I never saw him going there , and I pass it every Lord ' s day ." " I don ' t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting ," said I ; " all I know is , that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church . He is a deacon himself , Queequeg is ." " Young man ," said Bildad sternly , " thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself	s
of ' em ; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish . There was young Nat Swaine , once the bravest boat - header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard ; he joined the meeting , and never came to good . He got so frightened about his plaguy soul , that he shrinked and sheered away from whales , for fear of after - claps , in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones ." " Peleg ! Peleg !" said Bildad , lifting his eyes and hands , " thou thyself , as I myself , hast seen many a perilous time ; thou knowest , Peleg , what it is to have the fear of death ; how , then , can ' st thou prate in this ungodly guise . Thou beliest thine own heart , Peleg . Tell me , when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan , that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab , did ' st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then ?" " Hear him , hear him now ," cried	l
Peleg , marching across the cabin , and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets ,--" hear him , all of ye . Think of that ! When every moment we thought the ship would sink ! Death and the Judgment then ? What ? With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side ; and every sea breaking over us , fore and aft . Think of Death and the Judgment then ? No ! no time to think about Death then . Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of ; and	s
all . Anyhow , it ' s all fixed and arranged a ' ready ; and some sailors or other must go with him , I suppose ; as well these as any other men , God pity ' em ! Morning to ye , shipmates , morning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; I ' m sorry I stopped ye ." " Look here , friend ," said I , " if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us , you are mistaken in	s
that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two captains , Peleg and Bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage . If I had been downright honest with myself , I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open	s
me . It was Elijah . " Going aboard ?" " Hands off , will you ," said I . " Lookee here ," said Queequeg , shaking himself , " go ' way !" " Ain ' t going aboard , then ?" " Yes , we are ," said I , " but what business is that of yours ? Do you know , Mr . Elijah , that I consider you a little impertinent ?" " No , no , no ; I wasn ' t aware of that ," said Elijah , slowly and wonderingly looking	s
he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , " See if you can find ' em now , will ye ? " Find who ?" " Morning to ye ! morning to ye !" he rejoined , again moving off . " Oh ! I was going to warn ye against -- but never mind , never mind -- it ' s all one , all in the family too ;-- sharp frost this morning , ain ' t it ? Good - bye to ye . Shan ' t see ye again very	s
How now ! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage , Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter - deck , just as if they were to be joint - commanders at sea , as well as to all appearances in port . And , as for Captain Ahab , no sign of him was yet to be seen ; only , they said he was in the cabin . But then , the idea was , that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship	s
Queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot . I was comforting myself , however , with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay ; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear , and turning round , was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity . That was my first kick . "	s
words sound more sweetly to me than then . They were full of hope and fruition . Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and meads and glades so eternally vernal , that the grass shot up by the spring , untrodden , unwilted , remains at midsummer . At last we gained such an offing , that the two pilots were needed no longer . The stout sail - boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside . It was curious and not unpleasing , how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture , especially Captain Bildad . For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter	l
all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good - bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him ,-- poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far - off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and	s
000 ! and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $ 7 , 000 , 000 . How comes all this , if there be not something puissant in whaling ? But this is not the half ; look again . I freely assert , that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world , taken in one aggregate , than the high and mighty business of whaling . One way and another	s
in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it , then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and unhorse you with a split helmet every time . The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will say . THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR , AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER ? Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan ? Who but mighty Job ! And who composed the first narrative of a whaling - voyage ? Who , but no less a prince than Alfred the Great , who , with his own royal pen , took down the words from Other , the Norwegian whale - hunter of those times ! And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament ? Who , but Edmund Burke ! True enough , but then whalemen themselves are poor devils ; they have no good blood in their veins . NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS ? They have something better than royal blood there . The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel ; afterwards , by marriage , Mary	l
25 Postscript . In behalf of the dignity of whaling , I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts . But after embattling his facts , an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise , which might tell eloquently upon his cause -- such an advocate , would he not be blameworthy ? It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through . There is a saltcellar of state , so called , and there may be a castor of state . How they use the salt , precisely -- who knows ? Certain I am , however , that a king ' s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation , even as a head of salad . Can it be , though , that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well , as they anoint machinery ? Much might be ruminated here , concerning the essential dignity of this regal process , because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair , and	l
honest - hearted men , restrain the gush of dare - devil daring , so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery . " I will have no man in my boat ," said Starbuck , " who is not afraid of a whale ." By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward . " Aye , aye	s
been one cause , at least , of his peculiar disposition ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time of the cholera , some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal tribulations , Stubb ' s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent . The third mate was Flask , a native of Tisbury , in Martha	s
' s Vineyard . A short , stout , ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him , to destroy them whenever encountered . So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse , or at least water - rat , requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil . This ignorant , unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish for the fun of it ; and a three years ' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time . As a carpenter ' s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails ; so	l
momentous men . They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod ' s boats as headsmen . In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales , these three headsmen were as captains of companies . Or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked trio of lancers ; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins . And since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a Gothic Knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat - steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the Pequod ' s harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged . First of all was Queequeg , whom Starbuck , the chief mate , had selected for his	l
squire . But Queequeg is already known . Next was Tashtego , an unmixed Indian from Gay Head , the most westerly promontory of Martha ' s Vineyard , where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers . In the fishery , they usually go by the generic name of Gay - Headers . Tashtego ' s long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes -- for an Indian ,	s
Oriental in their largeness , but Antarctic in their glittering expression -- all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great New England moose , had scoured , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main . But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland , Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea ; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires . To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans , and half - believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air . Tashtego was Stubb the second mate ' s squire . Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , coal - black negro - savage , with a lion - like tread -- an Ahasuerus to behold . Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them	l
call such , not acknowledging the common continent of men , but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own . Yet now , federated along one keel , what a set these Isolatoes were ! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea , and all the ends of the earth , accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world ' s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back . Black Little Pip -- he never did -- oh , no ! he went before . Poor Alabama boy ! On the grim Pequod ' s forecastle , ye shall ere long see him , beating his tambourine ; prelusive of the eternal time , when sent for , to the great quarter - deck on high , he was bid strike in with angels , and beat his tambourine in glory ; called a coward here , hailed a hero there ! CHAPTER 28 Ahab . For several days after leaving Nantucket , nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab . The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for	l
aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously . Yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin . Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below , I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible ; for	s
especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings , and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage . Three better , more likely sea - officers and men , each in his own different way , could not readily be found , and they were every one of them Americans ; a Nantucketer , a Vineyarder , a Cape man . Now , it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor , for a space we had	s
weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood . For , as when the red - cheeked , dancing girls , April and May , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder - cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such glad - hearted visitants ; so Ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air . More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of	s
. " It ' s very queer . Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I don ' t well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what ' s that ?-- down here on my knees and pray for him ? Yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time I ever DID pray . It ' s queer ; very queer ; and he ' s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he ' s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with . How he flashed at me !-- his eyes like powder - pans ! is he mad ? Anyway there ' s something on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks . He aint in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the twenty - four ; and he don ' t sleep then . Didn ' t that Dough - Boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man ' s hammock	l
. He ' s full of riddles ; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as Dough - Boy tells me he suspects ; what ' s that for , I should like to know ? Who ' s made appointments with him in the hold ? Ain ' t that queer , now ? But there ' s no telling , it ' s the old game -- Here goes for a snooze . Damn me , it ' s worth a fellow ' s while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep . And now that I think of it , that ' s about the first thing babies do , and that ' s a sort of queer , too . Damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of ' em . But that ' s against my principles . Think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- So here goes again . But how ' s that ? didn ' t he call me a dog ? blazes	l
Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea ." " A field strewn with thorns ." " All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists ." Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy . Nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales . Many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale . Run over a few :-- The Authors of the Bible ; Aristotle ; Pliny ; Aldrovandi ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Gesner ; Ray ; Linnaeus ; Rondeletius ; Willoughby ; Green ; Artedi ; Sibbald ; Brisson ; Marten ; Lacepede ; Bonneterre ; Desmarest ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; John Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; J . Ross Browne ; the Author of Miriam Coffin ; Olmstead ; and the Rev . T . Cheever	l
argument , I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy Jonah to back me . This fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish . Above , Linnaeus has given you those items . But in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded . Next : how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him	s
remoter southern seas , and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance . He is never chased ; he would run away with rope - walks of line . Prodigies are told of him . Adieu , Sulphur Bottom ! I can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest Nantucketer . Thus ends BOOK I . ( FOLIO ), and now begins BOOK II . ( OCTAVO ). OCTAVOES .*-- These embrace the whales of middling magnitude , among which present may be numbered :-- I ., the GRAMPUS ;	s
answers , it would be hard to say . It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword - fish and bill - fish ; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food . Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice - piercer ; for the Narwhale , rising to the surface of the Polar Sea , and finding it sheeted with ice , thrusts his horn up , and so breaks through . But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct . My own opinion is , that however this one - sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets . The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale , the Horned whale , and the Unicorn whale . He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature . From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea - unicorn	l
( THRASHER ).-- This gentleman is famous for his tail , which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes . He mounts the Folio whale ' s back , and as he swims , he works his passage by flogging him ; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process . Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer . Both are outlaws , even in the lawless seas . Thus ends BOOK II . ( OCTAVO ), and begins BOOK III . ( DUODECIMO ). DUODECIMOES .-- These include the smaller whales . I . The Huzza Porpoise . II . The Algerine Porpoise . III . The Mealy - mouthed Porpoise . To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject , it may possibly seem strange , that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES -- a word , which , in the popular sense , always conveys an idea of hugeness . But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales , by the terms of my definition of what a whale is -- i . e	l
. a spouting fish , with a horizontal tail . BOOK III . ( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER 1 . ( HUZZA PORPOISE ).-- This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe . The name is of my own bestowal ; for there are more than one sort of porpoises , and something must be done to distinguish them . I call him thus , because he always swims in hilarious shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth - of - July crowd . Their appearance is generally	s
hailed with delight by the mariner . Full of fine spirits , they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward . They are the lads that always live before the wind . They are accounted a lucky omen . If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye . A well - fed , plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil . But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable . It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers . Sailors put it on their hones . Porpoise meat is good eating , you know . It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts . Indeed , his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible . But the next time you have a chance , watch him ; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature . BOOK III . ( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER II . ( ALGERINE PORPOISE ).-- A pirate . Very savage . He is only found	l
, I think , in the Pacific . He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise , but much of the same general make . Provoke him , and he will buckle to a shark . I have lowered for him many times , but never yet saw him captured . BOOK III . ( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER III . ( MEALY - MOUTHED PORPOISE ).-- The largest kind of Porpoise ; and only found in the Pacific , so far as it is known . The only English name , by which he has hitherto been designated , is	s
little domestic peculiarity on ship - board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale - fleet . The large importance attached to the harpooneer ' s vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder . Literally this word means Fat - Cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer . In those days , the captain ' s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale - hunting department and all its concerns , the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme . In the British Greenland Fishery , under the corrupted title of Specksioneer , this old Dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged . At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer ; and as such , is but	l
imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot - cloth . And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; and though the only homage he ever exacted , was implicit , instantaneous obedience ; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter - deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of condescension or IN TERROREM , or otherwise ; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea . Nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and usages , as it were , he sometimes masked himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve . That certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship	l
dinner , and Flask is the first man up . Consider ! For hereby Flask ' s dinner was badly jammed in point of time . Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear . If Stubb even , who is but a peg higher than Flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then Flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against	s
life of the worlds . Not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished . But Queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating -- an ugly sound enough -- so much so , that the trembling Dough - Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms . And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple - witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in	s
distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned . It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast - head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket , stands accountable . The worthy Obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea - coast , to which the look - outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen - house . A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready - manned boats nigh the beach . But this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then	l
the mast - head would amount to several entire months . And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves .	s
-- being left completely to myself at such a thought - engendering altitude -- how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale - ships ' standing orders , " Keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time ." And let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship - owners of Nantucket ! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head . Beware of	s
. But all in vain ; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short - sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ? They have left their opera - glasses at home . " Why , thou monkey ," said a harpooneer to one of these lads , " we ' ve been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet . Whales are scarce as hen ' s teeth whenever thou art up here ." Perhaps they were ; or	s
perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium - like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent - minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half - seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly - discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it . In this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like Crammer ' s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over . There is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable	l
mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement . " D ' ye mark him , Flask ?" whispered Stubb ; " the chick that ' s in him pecks the shell . ' Twill soon be out ." The hours wore on ;-- Ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same	s
whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat . But this did not last long . Vehemently pausing , he cried :-- " What do ye do when ye see a whale , men ?" " Sing out for him !" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices . " Good !" cried Ahab , with a wild approval in his tones ; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them . " And what do ye next , men	s
the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush ! Naught ' s an obstacle , naught ' s an angle to the iron way ! CHAPTER 38 Dusk . BY THE MAINMAST ; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT . My soul is more than matched ; she ' s overmanned ; and by a madman ! Insufferable sting , that sanity should ground arms on such a field !

brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them . Alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiseled hearth - stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth . No wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half - formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears . So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of	l
inch blade to reach the fathom - deep life of the whale . That captain was Ahab . And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle - shaped lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab ' s leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field . No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice . Small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations . The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung . That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one - half of the worlds ;	l
would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack . But be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him , Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all - engrossing object of hunting the White Whale . Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then , how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such	s
the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; and in the Greek mythologies , Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow - white bull ; and though to the noble Iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from the Latin word for white , all Christian priests derive the name of one	s
from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , Ishmael . Tell me , why this strong young colt , foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont , far removed from all beasts of prey -- why is it that upon the sunniest day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him , so that he cannot even see it , but only smells its wild animal muskiness -- why will he start , snort , and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright ? There is no remembrance in him of	s
the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed - down table . Then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank . At intervals , he would refer to piles of old log - books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships	s
s resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring - shoals or the flights of swallows . On this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale .* * Since the above was written , the statement is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by Lieutenant Maury , of the National Observatory , Washington , April 16th , 1851 . By that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular . " This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in	l
each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen ." Besides , when making a passage from one feeding - ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct -- say , rather , secret intelligence from the Deity -- mostly swim in VEINS , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean - line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one	s
circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme . But not so in the reality , perhaps . Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true . In general , the same remark	s
tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance . But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest . Now , the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the Season - on - the - Line . No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards , double Cape Horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there . Therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season . Yet the premature hour of the Pequod ' s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things . Because , an interval of three hundred and sixty - five days and nights was	l
the devious zig - zag world - circle of the Pequod ' s circumnavigating wake . But granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white - bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople ? Yes . For the peculiar snow - white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow - white hump , could not but be unmistakable . And have I not tallied the whale , Ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him , and shall he escape ? His broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep ' s ear ! And here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his	l
three - year instance , it so fell out that I was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale ' s eye , which I had observed there three years previous . I say three years , but I am pretty sure it was more than that . Here are three instances , then , which I personally know the truth of ; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach . Secondly : It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery , however ignorant the world ashore may be of it , that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable . Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him , and boiling	l
Don Miguel ! thou Chilian whale , marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back ! In plain prose , here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar . But this is not all . New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel , after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels , were finally gone in quest of , systematically hunted out , chased and killed by valiant whaling captains , who heaved up their anchors with that express object	s
conception of those perils , and the frequency with which they recur . One reason perhaps is , that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery , ever finds a public record at home , however transient and immediately forgotten that record . Do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale - line off the coast of New Guinea , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan -- do you suppose that that poor fellow '	s
s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to - morrow at your breakfast ? No : because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea . In fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea ? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat ' s crew . For God ' s sake , be economical with your lamps and candles ! not a gallon you burn , but at least one drop of man ' s blood was spilled for it . Secondly : People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two - fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , I declare upon my soul ,	l
dashed upon hidden rocks , with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation , seemed scarcely entitled to a moment ' s thought ; the dismal looking wreck , and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE , wholly engrossed my reflections , until day again made its appearance ." In another place -- p . 45 ,-- he speaks of " THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL ." Secondly : The ship Union , also of Nantucket , was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset , but the	s
authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it . Thirdly : Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J ---, then commanding an American sloop - of - war of the first class , happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains , on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu , Sandwich Islands . Conversation turning upon whales , the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present . He peremptorily denied for example , that any whale could so smite his stout sloop - of - war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful . Very good ; but there is more coming . Some weeks after , the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso . But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments ' confidential business with him . That business consisted in fetching the Commodore ' s craft such a thwack , that with all his	l
who , after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea - captain , this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston . I have the honour of being a nephew of his . I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff . He substantiates every word . The ship , however , was by no means a large one : a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast , and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home . In that up and down manly book of old - fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders -- the voyage of Lionel Wafer , one of ancient Dampier ' s old chums -- I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff , that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example , if such be needed . Lionel , it seems , was on his way to " John Ferdinando ," as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes . " In our way thither ," he says , " about four o ' clock in the	l
sea - monster was , is not mentioned . But as he destroyed ships , as well as for other reasons , he must have been a whale ; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale . And I will tell you why . For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it . Even now I am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort . But further investigations have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean . I am told , on good authority , that on the Barbary coast , a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale . Now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis . In the Propontis , as	l
he hunted . But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable , there were still additional considerations which , though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion , yet were by no means incapable of swaying him . To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools ; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order . He knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual	s
the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background ( for few men ' s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action ); that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick . For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness -- and	s
glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head . Less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger - yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas ;-- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting - room they suppose to be elsewhere . While yet the wondering ship ' s company were gazing upon these strangers , Ahab cried out to the white - turbaned old man at their head , " All ready there , Fedallah ?" " Ready ," was the half - hissed reply . " Lower away then ; d ' ye hear ?" shouting across the deck . " Lower away there , I say ." Such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the	l
a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form . On his broad back , flaxen - haired Flask seemed a snow - flake . The bearer looked nobler than the rider . Though truly vivacious , tumultuous , ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience ; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro ' s lordly chest . So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth , but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that . Meanwhile Stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far - gazing solicitudes . The whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , Stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe . He withdrew it from his hatband , where he always wore it aslant like a feather . He loaded it , and rammed home	l
compasses . He did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him . Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty . How different the loud little King - Post . " Sing out and say something , my hearties . Roar and pull , my thunderbolts ! Beach me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and I ' ll sign over	s
who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck ' s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck ' s boat ; and finally considering in what a devil ' s chase I was implicated , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will . " Queequeg ," said I , " come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee ." It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments , but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion . This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing . After	l
moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale - boat in the hunt ? As a general thing , the joint - owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not . Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat ' s crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod . Therefore he had not solicited a boat ' s crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head . Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter . Until Cabaco ' s published discovery , the sailors had little	l
foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole - pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in	s
seas . These temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn - like prow . But , at last , when turning to the eastward , the Cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory - tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foam - flakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before . Close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea -	l
Though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell - tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling .* * The cabin - compass is called the tell - tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship . Terrible old man ! thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose . CHAPTER 52 The Albatross .	s
they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast - heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn - looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look - outs , while the quarter - deck hail was being heard from below . " Ship ahoy ! Have ye seen the	s
White Whale ?" But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it . Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between . While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale ' s name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade . But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed --" Ahoy there ! This is the Pequod , bound round the world ! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean ! and this time three years , if I am not at home	l
that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed . CHAPTER 53 The Gam . The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms . But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had	s
own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery . In a pirate , man - of - war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner ' s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons . But the whale - boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all . High times indeed , if whaling	s
now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town - Ho ' s story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men . This latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates . For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town	s
her . In truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the Town - Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney , the mate , a Vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt , a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo . "' Lakeman !-- Buffalo ! Pray , what is a Lakeman , and where is Buffalo ?' said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass . " On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie , Don ; but -- I crave your courtesy -- may be , you shall soon hear further of all that . Now , gentlemen , in square - sail brigs and three - masted ships , well - nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the land - locked heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean .	l
For in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh - water seas of ours ,-- Erie , and Ontario , and Huron , and Superior , and Michigan ,-- possess an ocean - like expansiveness , with many of the ocean ' s noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes . They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the Polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies	s
from the East , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat - like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland , as well as Winnebago villages ; they float alike the full - rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the State , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew .	l
probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom . Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump - handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ; that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them . It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out	s
and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large . " Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship ' s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time . Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea - usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces . But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard . Besides , it was the stronger men in the Town - Ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with	l
the holy city of the blessed evangelist , St . Mark !-- St . Dominic , purge it ! Your cup ! Thanks : here I refill ; now , you pour out again .' " Freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he . Like Mark Antony , for days and days along his green - turfed , flowery Nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red - cheeked Cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck	s
the story .' " I left off , gentlemen , where the Lakeman shook the backstay . Hardly had he done so , when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers , who all crowded him to the deck . But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets , the two Canallers rushed into the uproar , and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle . Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt , and a twisted turmoil ensued ; while standing out of harm ' s way , the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale - pike , calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel , and smoke him along to the quarter - deck . At intervals , he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion , and prying into the heart of it with his pike , sought to prick out the object of his resentment . But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks	l
in a line with the windlass , these sea - Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade . "' Come out of that , ye pirates !' roared the captain , now menacing them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward . ' Come out of that , ye cut - throats !' " Steelkilt leaped on the barricade , and striding up and down there , defied the worst the pistols could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his ( Steelkilt ' s ) death would be the	s
, the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade , and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle , planted their group of hands upon it , and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway . Then opening the slide a little , the Captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained neutral . " All night a wide - awake watch was kept by all the officers , forward and aft , especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway ; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge , after breaking through the bulkhead below . But the hours of darkness passed in peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps , whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship . " At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they	l
the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body . But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered . For , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the Town - Ho still maintained her mast - heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment	s
as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in . " But , gentlemen , a fool saved the would - be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned . Yet complete revenge he had , and without being the avenger . For by a mysterious fatality , Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done . " It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were washing down the decks , that a stupid Teneriffe man , drawing water in the main - chains , all at once shouted out , ' There she rolls ! there she rolls !' Jesu , what a whale ! It was Moby Dick . "' Moby Dick !' cried Don Sebastian ; ' St . Dominic ! Sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ? Whom call you Moby Dick ?' "' A very white , and famous , and most deadly immortal monster , Don ;-- but that would be too long a story .' "' How ? how ?' cried all the young Spaniards ,	l
was free . But , at some distance , Moby Dick rose again , with some tatters of Radney ' s red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him . All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared . " In good time , the Town - Ho reached her port -- a savage , solitary place -- where no civilized creature resided . There , headed by the Lakeman , all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms ; eventually ,	s
five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew . " On the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals . He steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water . The captain presented a pistol . With one foot on each prow of the yoked war - canoes , the Lakeman laughed him to scorn	s
the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn , gentlemen ?' "' Nay ,' said Don Sebastian ; ' but I know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly procure one for me . I go for it ; but are you well advised ? this may grow too serious .' "' Will you be so good as to bring the priest also , Don ?' "' Though there are no Auto - da - Fe ' s in Lima now ,' said one of the company to another ; ' I fear our sailor friend runs risk of	s
the archiepiscopacy . Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight . I see no need of this .' "' Excuse me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can .' ' This is the priest , he brings you the Evangelists ,' said Don Sebastian , gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure . "' Let me remove my hat . Now , venerable priest , further into the light , and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it . "' So help me Heaven , and on my honour the story I have told ye , gentlemen , is in substance and its great items , true . I know it to be true ; it happened on this ball ; I trod the ship ; I knew the crew ; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney .'" CHAPTER 55 Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales . I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of	l
the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale - ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there . It may be worth while , therefore , previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman . It is time to set the world right in this matter , by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong . It may be that the primal source of	s
and even down to a comparatively late period , dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan . In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d ' eau , hot springs and cold , Saratoga and Baden - Baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain . In the title - page of the original edition of the " Advancement of Learning " you will find some curious whales . But quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know . In old Harris ' s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages , A . D . 1671 , entitled " A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale , Peter Peterson of Friesland , master ." In one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice - isles , with white bears	l
, 1793 , and hoisted on deck ." I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines . To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow - window some five feet long . Ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye ! Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake . Look at that popular work " Goldsmith ' s Animated Nature ." In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged " whale " and a " narwhale ." I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for	l
dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint . But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all . Consider ! Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars . Though	s
will find in the western clearings . But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump - speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation . Throughout the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling - scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale - teeth , or ladies ' busks wrought out of the Right Whale - bone , and other like skrimshander articles	s
, as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure . Some of them have little boxes of dentistical - looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business . But , in general , they toil with their jack - knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner ' s fancy . Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him , i . e . what is called savagery . Your true whale - hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois . I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him . Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry . An ancient Hawaiian war - club or spear - paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving ,	l
, not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the Greek savage , Achilles ' s shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage , Albert Durer . Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war - wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers . Some of them are done with much accuracy . At some old gable - roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road - side door . When the porter is sleepy , the anvil - headed whale would be best . But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays . On the spires of some old - fashioned churches you will see sheet - iron whales placed there for weather - cocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with " HANDS OFF !" you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit . In	l
reach . No perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance - like apparition of life . As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed --" Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost !" " What was it , Sir ?" said Flask . "	s
rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale - line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope ' s durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss . Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale - lines ; for , though not	s
: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety ' s sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town - crier would ever find her again . Before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man ' s oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it	l
in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air . " Clear away the boats ! Luff !" cried Ahab . And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes . The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down	s
but keep cool , keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy , easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves , boys -- that ' s all . Start her !" " Woo - hoo ! Wa - hee !" screamed the Gay - Header in reply , raising some old war - whoop to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave . But his wild screams	s
steady fumes from his pipe . As the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb ' s hands , from which the hand - cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped . It was like holding an enemy ' s sharp two - edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch . " Wet the line ! wet the line	s
one and the same time . In this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry --" Stand up , and give it to him !" He now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale . No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out	s
of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted ! Again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else . It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat . Now , I care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary .	l
dat dam racket !" " Cook ," here interposed Stubb , accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder ,--" Cook ! why , damn your eyes , you mustn ' t swear that way when you ' re preaching . That ' s no way to convert sinners , cook !" " Who dat ? Den preach to him yourself ," sullenly turning to go . " No , cook ; go on , go on ." " Well , den , Belubed fellow - critters :"- " Right !" exclaimed Stubb , approvingly , " coax	s
' em to it ; try that ," and Fleece continued . " Do you is all sharks , and by natur wery woracious , yet I zay to you , fellow - critters , dat dat woraciousness --' top dat dam slappin ' ob de tail ! How you tink to hear , spose you keep up such a dam slappin ' and bitin ' dare ?" " Cook ," cried Stubb , collaring him , " I won ' t have that swearing . Talk to ' em gentlemanly ." Once more the sermon proceeded . " Your woraciousness , fellow - critters , I don ' t blame ye so much for ; dat is natur , and can ' t be helped ; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint . You is sharks , sartin ; but if you gobern de shark in you , why den you be angel ; for all angel is not ' ing more dan de shark well goberned . Now , look here , bred ' ren , just try wonst to be cibil , a helping yourselbs from dat whale . Don ' t	l
; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee , I say , in the day of judgment , than for thee , civilized and enlightened gourmand , who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate - de - foie - gras . But Stubb , he eats the whale by its own light , does he ? and that is adding insult to injury , is it ? Look at your knife - handle , there , my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef , what is that handle made of ?-- what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating ? And what do you pick your teeth with , after devouring that fat goose ? With a feather of the same fowl . And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars ? It is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens . CHAPTER 66 The Shark Massacre . When in the Southern Fishery , a captured	l
parlor called the blubber - room . Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket - piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents . And thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber - room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction . CHAPTER 68 The Blanket . I have given no small attention to that	s
seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself . Nor is this all . In some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations . These are hieroglyphical ; that is , if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion . By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular , I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi . Like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic - marked whale remains undecipherable . This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing . Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance	l
might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element . And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it , by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast - head , and every yard - arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves ; there , that blood - dripping head hung to the Pequod ' s waist like the giant Holofernes ' s from the girdle of Judith . When this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner .	s
Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck . An intense copper calm , like a universal yellow lotus , was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea . A short space elapsed , and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin . Taking a few turns on the quarter - deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main - chains he took Stubb ' s long spade -- still remaining there after the whale ' s Decapitation -- and striking it into the lower part of the half - suspended mass , placed its other end crutch - wise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head . It was a black and hooded head ; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm , it seemed the Sphynx ' s in the desert . " Speak , thou vast and venerable head ," muttered Ahab , " which , though ungarnished with a beard , yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses ; speak , mighty head , and	l
?" " Three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us ! " Better and better , man . Would now St . Paul would come along that way , and to my breezelessness bring his breeze ! O Nature , and O soul of man ! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies ! not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter , but has its cunning duplicate in mind ." CHAPTER 71 The Jeroboam ' s Story . Hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ;	s
' s he ! that ' s he !-- the long - togged scaramouch the Town - Ho ' s company told us of !" Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town - Ho . According to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam . His story was this : He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap - door , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest - pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum . A strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common -	l
what he would ; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship . The consequence of all this was , that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the epidemic had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; declaring that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure . The sailors , mostly poor devils , cringed , and some of them fawned before him	s
man . Aye , aye , it ' s but a dim scrawl ;-- what ' s this ?" As he was studying it out , Starbuck took a long cutting - spade pole , and with his knife slightly split the end , to insert the letter there , and in that way , hand it to the boat , without its coming any closer to the ship . Meantime , Ahab holding the letter , muttered , " Mr . Har -- yes , Mr . Harry --( a woman ' s pinny hand ,-- the man ' s wife , I ' ll wager )-- Aye -- Mr . Harry Macey , Ship Jeroboam ;-- why it ' s Macey , and he ' s dead !" " Poor fellow ! poor fellow ! and from his wife ," sighed Mayhew ; " but let me have it ." " Nay , keep it thyself ," cried Gabriel to Ahab ; " thou art soon going that way ." " Curses throttle thee !" yelled Ahab . " Captain Mayhew , stand by now to receive it "; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck ' s	l
hands , he caught it in the slit of the pole , and reached it over towards the boat . But as he did so , the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing ; the boat drifted a little towards the ship ' s stern ; so that , as if by magic , the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel ' s eager hand . He clutched it in an instant , seized the boat - knife , and impaling the letter on it , sent it thus loaded back into the ship . It fell at Ahab ' s	s
feet . Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars , and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod . As , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair . CHAPTER 72 The Monkey - Rope . In the tumultuous business of cutting - in and attending to a whale , there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew . Now hands are wanted here , and then again hands are wanted there . There is no staying in any one place ; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere . It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene . We must now retrace our way a little . It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale ' s back , the blubber - hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates . But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook	l
your banker breaks , you snap ; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills , you die . True , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life . But handle Queequeg ' s monkey - rope heedfully as I would , sometimes he jerked it so , that I came very near sliding overboard . Nor could I possibly forget that , do what I would , I only had the management of one end of it .* * The monkey	s
wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach . This procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them . They meant Queequeg ' s best happiness , I admit ; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood - muddled water , those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall . But poor Queequeg , I suppose , straining and gasping there with that great iron hook -- poor Queequeg , I suppose , only prayed to his Yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods . Well , well , my dear comrade and twin - brother , thought I , as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea -- what matters it , after all ? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world ? That unsounded ocean you gasp in , is Life ; those sharks , your foes ; those	l
s countenance , he added , " The steward , Mr . Starbuck , had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg , there , this instant off the whale . Is the steward an apothecary , sir ? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half - drowned man ?" " I trust not ," said Starbuck , " it is poor stuff enough ." " Aye , aye , steward ," cried Stubb , " we ' ll teach you to drug	s
: go down with him , and get what thou wantest thyself ." When Stubb reappeared , he came with a dark flask in one hand , and a sort of tea - caddy in the other . The first contained strong spirits , and was handed to Queequeg ; the second was Aunt Charity ' s gift , and that was freely given to the waves . CHAPTER 73 Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale ; and Then Have a Talk Over Him . It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm	s
Whale ' s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod ' s side . But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it . For the present other matters press , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold . Now , during the past night and forenoon , the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea , which , by its occasional patches of yellow brit , gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales , a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near . And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat ; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered . Nor was	l
they did gain it ; when instantly , a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel , as the strained line , scraping beneath the ship , suddenly rose to view under her bows , snapping and quivering ; and so flinging off its drippings , that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight , and once more the boats were free to fly . But the fagged whale abated his speed , and blindly altering his course , went round the stern of	s
said Flask , coiling some spare line in the boat ' s bow , " did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale ' s head hoisted on her starboard side , and at the same time a Right Whale ' s on the larboard ; did you never hear , Stubb , that that ship can never afterwards capsize ?" " Why not ? " I don ' t know , but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so , and he seems to know all about ships ' charms	s
go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in Kant ' s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight . Thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat . Oh , ye foolish ! throw all these thunder - heads overboard , and then you will float light and right . In disposing of the body of a right whale , when brought alongside the ship , the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale ; only , in the latter instance , the head is cut off whole , but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck , with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown - piece . But nothing like this , in the present case , had been done . The carcases of both whales had dropped astern ; and the head - laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers . Meantime , Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale ' s head , and ever and anon	l
, in point of pervading dignity . In the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience . In short , he is what the fishermen technically call a " grey - headed whale ." Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads -- namely , the two most important organs , the eye and the ear . Far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of	s
separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness . How is it , then , with the whale ? True , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man ' s , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ? If he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid . Nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison . It may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four	l
boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them . But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye . If you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ . The ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly	s
come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff - box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side . If you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas ! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force . But far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right - angles with his body , for all the world like a ship ' s jib - boom . This whale is not dead ; he is only dispirited ; out of sorts , perhaps ; hypochondriac ; and so supine , that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed , leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight , a reproach to all his tribe , who must	l
all the fashion . And as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone . But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the Right Whale ' s mouth , look around you afresh . Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about , would	s
youth lifting the dread goddess ' s veil at Lais ? CHAPTER 77 The Great Heidelburgh Tun . Now comes the Baling of the Case . But to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon . Regarding the Sperm Whale ' s head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins ,* whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its	s
sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water . A large whale ' s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can . I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl - coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale ' s case . It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty - six feet for the depth of the tun , when it	l
, whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter . Thus much being said , attend now , I pray you , to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale ' s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped . CHAPTER 78 Cistern and Buckets . Nimble as a cat , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard - arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun . He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single - sheaved block . Securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard - arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck . Then , hand - over - hand , down the other part , the Indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head . There -- still high elevated above the	l
rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower . A short - handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun . In this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure - hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in . By the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron - bound bucket	s
and all caught their breath , as half swinging -- now over the sailors ' heads , and now over the water -- Daggoo , through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles , while poor , buried - alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea ! But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away , when a naked figure with a boarding - sword in his hand , was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks . The next , a loud splash announced that	s
, and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a somerset upon the Indian ; so that with the next trial , he came forth in the good old way -- head foremost . As for the great head itself , that was doing as well as could be expected . And thus , through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , delivery of Tashtego , was successfully accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten . Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing , riding and rowing . I know that this queer adventure of the Gay - Header ' s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one ' s falling into a cistern ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the Indian ' s , considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale ' s well	l
in that famous work of his , Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men , but also attentively studies the faces of horses , birds , serpents , and fish ; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein . Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man . Therefore , though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi - sciences to the whale , I will do my endeavor . I try all things ; I achieve what I can . Physiognomically regarded , the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature . He has no proper nose . And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale . For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed	l
egotistical sky ; in the now unhaunted hill ; then be sure , exalted to Jove ' s high seat , the great Sperm Whale shall lord it . Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics . But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man ' s and every being ' s face . Physiognomy , like every other human science , is but a passing fable . If then , Sir William Jones , who read in thirty languages , could not read the simplest peasant ' s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings , how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale ' s brow ? I but put that brow before you . Read it if you can . CHAPTER 80 The Nut . If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx , to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square . In the full - grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length . Unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined	l
his apparent forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks , like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec . So like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic - yards of his sperm magazine . Lying in strange folds , courses , and convolutions , to their apprehensions , it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence . It is plain , then , that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan , in the creature ' s living intact state , is an entire delusion . As for his true brain , you can then see no indications of it , nor feel any . The whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world . If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the	l
affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is . But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale ' s proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then I have another idea for you . If you attentively regard almost any quadruped ' s spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper . It is a German conceit , that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls . But the curious external resemblance , I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive . A foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso - relievo , the beaked prow of his canoe . Now , I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through	l
declare . As he mounted the deck , Ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp - feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of Bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying - fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one ( that is , an empty one ), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin . His necessities supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship ' s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast - heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his oil - can and lamp - feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp -	l
though every moment neared by his foreign rivals . The only thing they feared , was , that from being already so nigh to his mark , he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him . As for Derick , he seemed quite confident that this would be the case , and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp - feeder at the other boats . " The ungracious and ungrateful dog !" cried Starbuck ; " he mocks and dares me with the very poor - box I filled for	s
! such a sogger ! Don ' t ye love sperm ? There goes three thousand dollars , men !-- a bank !-- a whole bank ! The bank of England !-- Oh , DO , DO , DO !-- What ' s that Yarman about now ?" At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp - feeder at the advancing boats , and also his oil - can ; perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals ' way , and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss . " The unmannerly Dutch dogger !" cried Stubb . " Pull now , men , like fifty thousand line - of - battle - ship loads of red - haired devils . What d ' ye say , Tashtego ; are you the man to snap your spine in two - and - twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead ? What d ' ye say ?" " I say , pull like god - dam ,"-- cried the Indian . Fiercely , but evenly incited by the taunts of the German , the Pequod	l
at every billow that he broke , he spasmodically sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin . So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air , vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks . But the bird has a voice , and with plaintive cries will make known her fear ; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea , was chained up and enchanted in him ; he had no voice , save that choking respiration through his spiracle ,	s
sharp lance of his foes . Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing , it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best ; for it is but reasonable to presume , that the longer the stricken whale stays under water , the more he is exhausted . Because , owing to the enormous surface of him -- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet -- the pressure of the water is immense . We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under ; even here , above - ground , in the air ; how vast , then , the burden of a whale , bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean ! It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres . One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line - of - battle ships , with all their guns , and stores , and men on board . As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea , gazing down into its eternal blue noon ; and as not a single	l
groan or cry of any sort , nay , not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths ; what landsman would have thought , that beneath all that silence and placidity , the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony ! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows . Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock . Suspended ? and to what ? To three bits of board . Is	s
buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords . By very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke - chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom . It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the	s
and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke - chains . But a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest . With a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank . Now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it . Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface	s
would accommodate a couple of whist - tables , and comfortably seat all the players . Possibly , too , Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the Right Whale is toothless . Another reason which Sag - Harbor ( he went by that name ) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale ' s gastric juices . But this objection likewise falls to the ground , because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a DEAD whale -- even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents , and crawled into them . Besides , it has been divined by other continental commentators , that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship , he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by , some vessel with a whale for a figure - head ; and , I would add , possibly called " The Whale ," as some craft are nowadays christened the " Shark	l
, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days ' journey of Nineveh , a city on the Tigris , very much more than three days ' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast . How is that ? But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh ? Yes . He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope . But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean , and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days , not to speak of the Tigris waters , near the site of Nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in . Besides , this idea of Jonah ' s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar . But all these foolish arguments	l
tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface . But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being ' s , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere . Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world . But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the Sperm Whale ' s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth . No , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head . If I say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying	l
full term below . Remark , however , that in different individuals these rates are different ; but in any one they are alike . Now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ? How obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale ' s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase . For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight . Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee ! In man , breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will . But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time . It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout - hole ; if	l
as to what it is precisely . The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him . And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout , how do you know that they are not merely condensed from	s
seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone . Still , we can hypothesize , even if we cannot prove and establish . My hypothesis is this : that the spout is nothing but mist . And besides other reasons , to this conclusion I am impelled , by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale ; I account him no common , shallow being , inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings , or near shores ; all other whales sometimes are . He is both ponderous and profound . And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings , such as Plato , Pyrrho , the Devil , Jupiter , Dante , and so on , there always goes up a certain semi - visible steam , while in the act of thinking deep thoughts . While composing a little treatise on Eternity , I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me ; and ere long saw reflected there , a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head . The invariable moisture of	l
whole whale seems concentrated to a point . Could annihilation occur to matter , this were the thing to do it . Nor does this -- its amazing strength , at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions ; where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of power . On the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it . Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony , but it often bestows it ; and in everything imposingly beautiful , strength has much to do with the magic . Take away the tied	s
of propulsion . Scroll - wise coiled forwards beneath the body , and then rapidly sprung backwards , it is this which gives that singular darting , leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming . His side - fins only serve to steer by . Second : It is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail . In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil . If it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible . No ribs of man or boat can withstand it . Your only salvation lies in eluding it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat , and the elasticity of its materials , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of stitch in the side ,	l
is generally the most serious result . These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child ' s play . Some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped . Third : I cannot demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant ' s trunk . This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of	s
is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk , and then elevating it , jet it forth in a stream . The more I consider this mighty tail , the more do I deplore my inability to express it . At times there are gestures in it , which , though they would well grace the hand of man , remain wholly inexplicable . In an extensive herd , so remarkable , occasionally , are these mystic gestures , that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free -	s
Mason signs and symbols ; that the whale , indeed , by these methods intelligently conversed with the world . Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of strangeness , and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant . Dissect him how I may , then , I but go skin deep ; I know him not , and never will . But if I know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ? much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ? Thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen . But I cannot completely make out his back parts ; and hint what he will about his face , I say again he has no face . CHAPTER 87 The Grand Armada . The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca , extending south - eastward from the territories of Birmah , forms the most southerly point of all Asia . In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra , Java , Bally	l
, and Timor ; which , with many others , form a vast mole , or rampart , lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia , and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes . This rampart is pierced by several sally - ports for the convenience of ships and whales ; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca . By the straits of Sunda , chiefly , vessels bound to China from the west , emerge into the China seas . Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java ; and standing	s
jets of the Right Whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward - slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward . Seen from the Pequod ' s deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapoury spouts , individually curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze , showed	s
this sight , Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot - hole , crying , " Aloft there , and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails ;-- Malays , sir , and after us !" As if too long lurking behind the headlands , till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their over - cautious delay . But when the swift Pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit ,-- mere riding - whips and rowels to her , that they were . As with glass under arm , Ahab to - and - fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his . And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing , and bethought him that through that gate lay the route	l
these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays . But still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed abating their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats . But no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them ,-- though as yet a mile in their rear ,-- than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity . Stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the	l
white - ash , and after several hours ' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied . The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like King Porus ' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander ,	s
' s harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd . Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise unprecedented ; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery . For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb . As , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice - isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what	l
me , deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy . Meanwhile , as we thus lay entranced , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them . But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing	s
stand by ! Shove him off , you Queequeg -- the whale there !-- prick him !-- hit him ! Stand up -- stand up , and stay so ! Spring , men -- pull , men ; never mind their backs -- scrape them !-- scrape away !" The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths . But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet .	s
as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors . Now , as the harem of whales is called	s
by the fishermen a school , so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster . It is therefore not in strict character , however admirably satirical , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there , but the folly of it . His title , schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself , but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale , must have read the memoirs of Vidocq , and informed himself what sort of a country - schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days , and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils . The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged Sperm Whales . Almost universally , a lone whale -- as a solitary Leviathan is called -- proves an ancient one . Like venerable moss - bearded Daniel Boone , he will have no one near him but Nature herself	l
a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they . I . A Fast - Fish belongs to the party fast to it . II . A Loose - Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it . But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it . First : What is a Fast - Fish ? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat	s
." " Won ' t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half ?" " It is his ." In a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money . Thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full	s
distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside . As we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colours from his peak ; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea - fowl that circled , and hovered , and swooped around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died unmolested on the sea , and so floated an unappropriated corpse . It may well be conceived , what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale ; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague , when the living are incompetent to bury the departed . So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it . Yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of attar - of - rose . Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze , we saw that the Frenchman	l
had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade - pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales . " There ' s a pretty fellow , now ," he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship ' s bows , " there ' s a jackal for ye ! I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles , and cases of snuffers , foreseeing that all the oil they will get won ' t be enough to dip the Captain ' s wick into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here ' s a Crappo that is content with our leavings , the drugged whale there , I mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there . Poor devil ! I say , pass	l
round a hat , some one , and let ' s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity ' s sake . For what oil he ' ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn ' t be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell . And as for the other whale , why , I ' ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he ' ll get from that bundle of bones ; though ,	s
same purpose that frankincense is carried to St . Peter ' s in Rome . Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it . Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale ! Yet so it is . By some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale . How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by	s
Fogo Von Slack , in his great work on Smells , a text - book on that subject . As its name imports ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ), this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose . It was a collection of furnaces , fat - kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor . But all	s
this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless . The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose . Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air . I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale ' s flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk - scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor . What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to	l
lowered with him , Pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though Stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful . Now upon the second lowering , the boat paddled upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary rap , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor Pip ' s seat . The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap , paddle in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest , he breasted it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last plumping into the water . That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and presto ! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged	l
this entire thing happened . " Damn him , cut !" roared Stubb ; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved . So soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew . Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate , Stubb then in a plain , business - like , but still half humorous manner , cursed Pip officially ; and that done , unofficially gave him much wholesome advice . The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except -- but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is . Now , in general , STICK TO THE BOAT , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT , is still better . Moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command , " Stick to the boat , Pip ,	l
or by the Lord , I won ' t pick you up if you jump ; mind that . We can ' t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama . Bear that in mind , and don ' t jump any more ." Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money - making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence . But we are all in the hands	s
as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try - works , of which anon . It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree , that when , with several others , I sat down before a large Constantine ' s bath of it , I found it strangely concreted into lumps , here and there rolling about in the liquid part . It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid . A sweet and unctuous duty ! No wonder that	s
, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules . Such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say ,-- Oh ! my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill - humor or envy ! Come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness . Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever ! For now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least shift , his conceit of attainable felicity ; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the saddle , the fireside , the country ; now that I have perceived all this , I am ready to squeeze	l
case eternally . In thoughts of the visions of the night , I saw long rows of angels in paradise , each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti . Now , while discoursing of sperm , it behooves to speak of other things akin to it , in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try - works . First comes white - horse , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the thicker portions of his flukes . It is tough with congealed tendons --	s
it is ; or , rather , in old times , its likeness was . Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea ; and for worshipping which , King Asa , her son , did depose her , and destroyed the idol , and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron , as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings . Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field . Extending it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt , as an African hunter the pelt of a boa . This done he turns the pelt inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to	l
operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse , planted endwise against the bulwarks , and with a capacious tub beneath it , into which the minced pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a rapt orator ' s desk . Arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a lad for a Pope were this mincer !* * Bible leaves ! Bible leaves ! This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer . It enjoins him to be careful , and cut his work into as thin slices as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated , and its quantity considerably increased , besides perhaps improving it in quality . CHAPTER 96 The Try - Works . Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try - works . She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship . It is as if from the open field a brick - kiln were transported	l
to her planks . The try - works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck . The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height . The foundation does not penetrate the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and screwing it down to the timbers . On the flanks it	s
the rear wall . And here let us go back for a moment . It was about nine o ' clock at night that the Pequod ' s try - works were first started on this present voyage . It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business . " All ready there ? Off hatch , then , and start her . You cook , fire the works ." This was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage . Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try - works has to be fed for a time with wood . After that no wood is used , except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel . In a word , after being tried out , the crisp , shrivelled blubber , now called scraps or fritters , still contains considerable of its unctuous properties . These fritters feed the flames . Like a plethoric burning martyr , or a self - consuming misanthrope , once ignited , the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body .	l
CHAPTER 97 The Lamp . Had you descended from the Pequod ' s try - works to the Pequod ' s forecastle , where the off duty watch were sleeping , for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors . There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults , each mariner a chiselled muteness ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes . In merchantmen , oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens . To dress in the dark ,	s
sacred quarter - deck enormous masses of the whale ' s head are profanely piled ; great rusty casks lie about , as in a brewery yard ; the smoke from the try - works has besooted all the bulwarks ; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness ; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself ; while on all hands the din is deafening . But a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this self - same ship ; and were it not for the tell - tale boats and try - works , you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel , with a most scrupulously neat commander . The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue . This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil . Besides , from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale , a potent lye is readily made ; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side , that lye quickly exterminates it . Hands go diligently	l
severest uninterrupted labors , which know no night ; continuing straight through for ninety - six hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line ,-- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and slash , yea , and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try - works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally bestirred	s
themselves to cleanse the ship , and make a spotless dairy room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks , are startled by the cry of " There she blows !" and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again . Oh ! my friends , but this is man - killing ! Yet this is life . For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world ' s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary patience , cleansed ourselves from its defilements , and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul ; hardly is this done , when -- THERE SHE BLOWS !-- the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life ' s old routine again . Oh ! the metempsychosis ! Oh ! Pythagoras , that in bright Greece , two thousand years ago , did die , so good , so wise , so mild ; I sailed with thee along the	l
Peruvian coast last voyage -- and , foolish as I am , taught thee , a green simple boy , how to splice a rope ! CHAPTER 99 The Doubloon . Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter - deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and	s
, raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills , whence , east and west , over golden sands , the head - waters of many a Pactolus flows . And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes , yet , untouchable and immaculate to any foulness , it still preserved its Quito glow . Nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless every sunrise	s
dark valley between three mighty , heaven - abiding peaks , that almost seem the Trinity , in some faint earthly symbol . So in this vale of Death , God girds us round ; and over all our gloom , the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope . If we bend down our eyes , the dark vale shows her mouldy soil ; but if we lift them , the bright sun meets our glance half way , to cheer . Yet , oh , the great sun is no fixture ; and if , at midnight , we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him , we gaze for him in vain ! This coin speaks wisely , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me . I will quit it , lest Truth shake me falsely ." " There now ' s the old Mogul ," soliloquized Stubb by the try - works , " he ' s been twigging it ; and there goes Starbuck from the same , and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long . And all from looking at	l
a piece of gold , which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer ' s Hook , I ' d not look at it very long ere spending it . Humph ! in my poor , insignificant opinion , I regard this as queer . I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings ; your doubloons of old Spain , your doubloons of Peru , your doubloons of Chili , your doubloons of Bolivia , your doubloons of Popayan ; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles , and joes , and half joes ,	s
twelve sitting - rooms all in a ring . Book ! you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places . You ' ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts . That ' s my small experience , so far as the Massachusetts calendar , and Bowditch ' s navigator , and Daboll ' s arithmetic go . Signs and wonders , eh ? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders ! There ' s a clue	s
ship ! my old head shakes to think of thee ." " There ' s another rendering now ; but still one text . All sorts of men in one kind of world , you see . Dodge again ! here comes Queequeg -- all tattooing -- looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself . What says the Cannibal ? As I live he ' s comparing notes ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the calf , or in the bowels , I suppose , as the old	s
women talk Surgeon ' s Astronomy in the back country . And by Jove , he ' s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh -- I guess it ' s Sagittarius , or the Archer . No : he don ' t know what to make of the doubloon ; he takes it for an old button off some king ' s trowsers . But , aside again ! here comes that ghost - devil , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual . What does he say , with that look of his ? Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin -- fire worshipper , depend upon it . Ho ! more and more . This way comes Pip -- poor boy ! would he had died , or I ; he ' s half horrible to me . He too has been watching all of these interpreters -- myself included -- and look now , he comes to read , with that unearthly idiot face . Stand away again and	l
hear him . Hark !" " I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look ." " Upon my soul , he ' s been studying Murray ' s Grammar ! Improving his mind , poor fellow ! But what ' s that he says now -- hist !" " I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look ." " Why , he ' s getting it by heart -- hist ! again ." " I look , you look , he looks	s
two officers of the strange ship , leaning over the side , by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there , and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully - ornamented man - ropes ; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one - legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters . But this awkwardness only lasted a minute , because the strange captain , observing at a glance how affairs stood , cried out , " I see , I see !-- avast heaving there ! Jump , boys , and swing over the cutting - tackle ." As good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved blubber - hook , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end . This was quickly lowered to Ahab , who at once comprehending it all , slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook ( it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor , or the crotch of an apple	l
other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains . But , at his superior ' s introduction of him to Ahab , he politely bowed , and straightway went on to do his captain ' s bidding . " It was a shocking bad wound ," began the whale - surgeon ; " and , taking my advice , Captain Boomer here , stood our old Sammy --" " Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship ," interrupted the one - armed captain , addressing Ahab ; " go on ,	s
Fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat ' s steering oar , and Ahab , swinging the cutting - tackle towards him , commanded the ship ' s sailors to stand by to lower . In a moment he was standing in the boat ' s stern , and the Manilla men were springing to their oars . In vain the English Captain hailed him . With back to the stranger ship , and face set like a flint to his own , Ahab stood upright till alongside of the	s
commanded by a Captain Coffin , a Nantucketer . All honour to the Enderbies , therefore , whose house , I think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world . The ship named after him was worthy of the honour , being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way . I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast , and drank good flip down in the forecastle . It was a fine gam	s
, to whom I handed the work for translation , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble -- this same Dr . Snodhead , so soon as he spied the book , assured me that " Dan Coopman " did not mean " The Cooper ," but " The Merchant ." In short , this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery . And in this chapter it was , headed , " Smeer ," or	s
wondrous sight . The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap ; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver ' s loom , with a gorgeous carpet on it , whereof the ground - vine tendrils formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures . All the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the shrubs , and ferns , and grasses ; the message - carrying air ; all these unceasingly were active . Through the lacings of	s
, I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I please . Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to , to test my accuracy . There is a Leviathanic Museum , they tell me , in Hull , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin - backs and other whales . Likewise , I have heard that in the museum of Manchester , in New Hampshire , they have what the proprietors call " the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States ." Moreover , at a place in Yorkshire , England , Burton Constable by name , a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full - grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo ' s . In both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds . King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and Sir Clifford , because he was lord of the	l
seignories of those parts . Sir Clifford ' s whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw . Locks are to be put upon some of his trap - doors and shutters ; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side . Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering	s
by way of preliminary , I desire to remind the reader , that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct ; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting , or at any rate intercepted links , between the antichronical creatures , and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark ; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period , which is the last preceding the superficial formations . And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time , they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects , to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils . Detached broken fossils of pre - adamite whales , fragments of their bones and skeletons , have within thirty years past , at various intervals , been found at the base of the Alps , in Lombardy , in France , in England , in Scotland , and in the States of Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama . Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull ,	l
whale ' s ; and , king of creation , he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs . Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan ? Ahab ' s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh ' s . Methuselah seems a school - boy . I look round to shake hands with Shem . I am horror - struck at this antemosaic , unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale , which , having been before all time , must needs exist after all humane ages are over . But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre - adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature , and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust ; but upon Egyptian tablets , whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character , we find the unmistakable print of his fin . In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere , abounding in centaurs , griffins , and dolphins , similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial	l
are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore . The Common People imagine , that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple , no Whale can pass it without immediate death . But the truth of the Matter is , that on either side of the Temple , there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea , and wound the Whales when they light upon ' em . They keep a Whale ' s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle , which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost , makes an Arch , the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel ' s Back . This Rib ( says John Leo ) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it . Their Historians affirm , that a Prophet who prophesy ' d of Mahomet , came from this Temple , and some do not stand to assert , that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple ." In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you , reader , and if	l
fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system ( embracing a distinct geological period prior to man ), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones . Of all the pre - adamite whales yet exhumed , by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton . Whereas , we have already seen , that the tape - measure gives seventy - two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale . And I have heard , on whalemen ' s authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture . But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since Adam ' s time they have degenerated ? Assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient	l
of Pharaoh ' s fat kine ; in the face of all this , I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated . But still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers . Whether owing to the almost omniscient look - outs at the mast - heads of the whaleships , now penetrating even through Behring ' s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is ,	s
whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff . Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo , which , not forty years ago , overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri , and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder - clotted brows upon the sites of populous river - capitals , where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch ; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished , to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction . But you must look at this matter in every light . Though so short a period ago -- not a good lifetime -- the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London , and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region	l
historian of Goa , when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took 4 , 000 elephants ; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes . And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by Semiramis , by Porus , by Hannibal , and by all the successive monarchs of the East -- if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale outlast all hunting , since he	s
has a pasture to expatiate in , which is precisely twice as large as all Asia , both Americas , Europe and Africa , New Holland , and all the Isles of the sea combined . Moreover : we are to consider , that from the presumed great longevity of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct adult generations must be contemporary . And what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by imagining all the grave - yards , cemeteries , and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive seventy - five years ago ; and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe . Wherefore , for all these things , we account the whale immortal in his species , however perishable in his individuality . He swam the seas before the continents broke water ; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries , and Windsor Castle , and the Kremlin . In Noah ' s flood he	l
extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter ' s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material . But , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years ' voyage , in uncivilized and far - distant seas . For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties :-- repairing stove boats , sprung spars , reforming the shape of clumsy - bladed oars , inserting bull ' s eyes in the deck , or new tree - nails in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes , both useful and capricious . The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold , was his vice - bench ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices ,	l
of different sizes , and both of iron and of wood . At all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try - works . A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter claps it into one of his ever - ready vices , and straightway files it smaller . A lost land - bird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive : out of clean shaved rods of right - whale bone , and	s
accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him , too ; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence . But not precisely so . For nothing was this man more remarkable , than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were ; impersonal , I say ; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things , that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world ; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes , still eternally holds its peace , and ignores you , though you dig	s
AND VARIOUS TOOLS OF ALL SORTS LYING ABOUT THE BENCH . FORWARD , THE RED FLAME OF THE FORGE IS SEEN , WHERE THE BLACKSMITH IS AT WORK .) Drat the file , and drat the bone ! That is hard which should be soft , and that is soft which should be hard . So we go , who file old jaws and shinbones . Let ' s try another . Aye , now , this works better ( SNEEZES ). Halloa , this bone dust is ( SNEEZES )-- why it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- yes it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- bless my soul , it won ' t let me speak ! This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber . Saw a live tree , and you don ' t get this dust ; amputate a live bone , and you don ' t get it ( SNEEZES ). Come , come , you old Smut , there , bear a hand , and let ' s have that ferule and buckle - screw ; I ' ll be ready for them presently . Lucky now ( SNEEZES )	l
will break bones -- beware , beware ! No fear ; I like a good grip ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man . What ' s Prometheus about there ?-- the blacksmith , I mean -- what ' s he about ? He must be forging the buckle - screw , sir , now . Right . It ' s a partnership ; he supplies the muscle part . He makes a fierce red flame there ! Aye , sir ; he must have the white heat for this kind of	s
fine work . Um - m . So he must . I do deem it now a most meaning thing , that that old Greek , Prometheus , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what ' s made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell ' s probable . How the soot flies ! This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of . Carpenter , when he ' s through with that buckle , tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder - blades ; there ' s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack . Sir ? Hold ; while Prometheus is about it , I ' ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern . Imprimis , fifty feet high in his socks ; then , chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel ; then , legs with roots to ' em , to stay in one place ; then , arms three feet through the wrist ; no heart at all , brass forehead , and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains	l
Ho , ho ! That ' s it , hey ? Here are two , sir ; one will serve my turn . What art thou thrusting that thief - catcher into my face for , man ? Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols . I thought , sir , that you spoke to carpenter . Carpenter ? why that ' s -- but no ;-- a very tidy , and , I may say , an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here , carpenter ;-- or would ' st thou rather work in clay ? Sir ?-- Clay ? clay , sir ? That ' s mud ; we leave clay to ditchers , sir . The fellow ' s impious ! What art thou sneezing about ? Bone is rather dusty , sir . Take the hint , then ; and when thou art dead , never bury thyself under living people ' s noses . Sir ?-- oh ! ah !-- I guess so ;-- yes -- dear ! Look ye , carpenter , I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman , eh ? Well , then , will	l

I almost forgot the little oval slate , smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude . So , so ; chisel , file , and sand - paper , now ! CHAPTER 109 Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin . According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning ; and lo ! no	s
" Captain Ahab ," said the reddening mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; " A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ; aye , and in a happier , Captain Ahab ." " Devils ! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me ?-- On deck !" " Nay , sir , not yet ; I do entreat . And I do dare , sir -- to be forbearing ! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto , Captain Ahab ?" Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack ( forming part of most South - Sea - men ' s cabin furniture ), and pointing it towards Starbuck , exclaimed : " There is one God that is Lord over the earth , and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod .-- On deck !" For an instant in	l
his face , as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died . For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books . And the drawing near of Death , which alike levels all , alike impresses all with a last revelation , which only an author from the dead could adequately tell . So that -- let us say it again -- no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those , whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg , as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock , and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest , and the ocean ' s invisible flood - tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven . Not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for Queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked . He called one to him in the grey morning watch , when the day was just breaking , and taking his hand , said that while in	l
for not only do they believe that the stars are isles , but that far beyond all visible horizons , their own mild , uncontinented seas , interflow with the blue heavens ; and so form the white breakers of the milky way . He added , that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock , according to the usual sea - custom , tossed like something vile to the death - devouring sharks . No : he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale - boat these coffin - canoes were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much lee - way adown the dim ages . Now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg ' s bidding , whatever it might include . There was some heathenish , coffin - coloured old lumber aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands , and from these dark planks the	l
tell all the Antilles he ' s a runaway ; a coward , a coward , a coward ! Tell them he jumped from a whale - boat ! I ' d never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here . No , no ! shame upon all cowards -- shame upon them ! Let ' em go drown like Pip , that jumped from a whale - boat . Shame ! shame !" During all this , Queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a	s
they were inscribed , and so be unsolved to the last . And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his , when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg --" Oh , devilish tantalization of the gods !" CHAPTER 111 The Pacific . When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea ; were it not for other things , I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks , for now the long supplication of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean	s
rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue . There is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St . John . And meet it is , that over these sea - pastures , wide - rolling watery prairies and Potters ' Fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever - rolling waves but made so by their restlessness . To any meditative Magian rover , this serene Pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his adoption . It rolls the midmost waters of the world , the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms . The same waves wash the moles of the new - built Californian towns , but yesterday	l
. But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab ' s brain , as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging , with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles ( in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking ), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming . Launched at length upon these almost final waters , and gliding towards the Japanese cruising - ground , the old man ' s purpose intensified itself . His firm lips met like the lips of a vice ; the Delta of his forehead ' s veins swelled like overladen brooks ; in his very sleep , his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull , " Stern all ! the White Whale spouts thick blood !" CHAPTER 112 The Blacksmith . Availing himself of the mild , summer - cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes , and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated , Perth , the begrimed , blistered old blacksmith ,	l
had not removed his portable forge to the hold again , after concluding his contributory work for Ahab ' s leg , but still retained it on deck , fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast ; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen , and harpooneers , and bowsmen to do some little job for them ; altering , or repairing , or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture . Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all waiting to be served ; holding boat - spades , pike - heads , harpoons	s
, and lances , and jealously watching his every sooty movement , as he toiled . Nevertheless , this old man ' s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm . No murmur , no impatience , no petulance did come from him . Silent , slow , and solemn ; bowing over still further his chronically broken back , he toiled away , as if toil were life itself , and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart . And so it was .-- Most miserable ! A peculiar walk in this old man , a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait , had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners . And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in ; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate . Belated , and not innocently , one bitter winter ' s midnight , on the road running between two country towns , the blacksmith half - stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him , and sought refuge	l
; till at last , Perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began hammering it upon the anvil -- the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights , some of which flew close to Ahab . " Are these thy Mother Carey ' s chickens , Perth ? they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ;-- look here , they burn ; but thou -- thou liv ' st among them without a scorch ." " Because I am scorched all over ,	s
the one , sir ! Said I not all seams and dents but one ?" " Aye , blacksmith , it is the one ; aye , man , it is unsmoothable ; for though thou only see ' st it here in my flesh , it has worked down into the bone of my skull -- THAT is all wrinkles ! But , away with child ' s play ; no more gaffs and pikes to - day . Look ye here !" jingling the leathern bag , as if it were full of gold coins . " I , too , want a harpoon made ; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part , Perth ; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin - bone . There ' s the stuff ," flinging the pouch upon the anvil . " Look ye , blacksmith , these are the gathered nail - stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses ." " Horse - shoe stubbs , sir ? Why , Captain Ahab , thou hast here , then , the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work ." " I	l
know it , old man ; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers . Quick ! forge me the harpoon . And forge me first , twelve rods for its shank ; then wind , and twist , and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow - line . Quick ! I ' ll blow the fire ." When at last the twelve rods were made , Ahab tried them , one by one , by spiralling them , with his own hand , round a long , heavy	s
-- the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the needle - sleet of the Icy Sea ." For a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them . " Take them , man , I have no need for them ; for I now neither shave , sup , nor pray till -- but here -- to work !" Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape , and welded by Perth to the shank , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to tempering them , he cried to Ahab to place the water - cask near . " No , no -- no water for that ; I want it of the true death - temper . Ahoy , there ! Tashtego , Queequeg , Daggoo ! What say ye , pagans ! Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ?" holding it high up . A cluster of dark nods replied , Yes . Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh	l
. At such times , under an abated sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a birch canoe ; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves , that like hearth - stone cats they purr against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy quietude , when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean ' s skin , one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it ; and would not willingly remember , that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang . These are the times , when in his whale - boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land - like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants ' horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure . The long - drawn	l
into that same golden sea , Starbuck lowly murmured :-- " Loveliness unfathomable , as ever lover saw in his young bride ' s eye !-- Tell me not of thy teeth - tiered sharks , and thy kidnapping cannibal ways . Let faith oust fact ; let fancy oust memory ; I look deep down and do believe ." And Stubb , fish - like , with sparkling scales , leaped up in that same golden light :-- " I am Stubb , and Stubb has his history ; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly !" CHAPTER 115 The Pequod Meets The Bachelor . And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind , some few weeks after Ahab ' s harpoon had been welded . It was a Nantucket ship , the Bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad holiday apparel , was joyously , though somewhat vain - gloriously , sailing round among the widely - separated ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow	l
in this life , when , on the right side , fortune ' s favourites sail close by us , we , though all adroop before , catch somewhat of the rushing breeze , and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out . So seemed it with the Pequod . For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by Ahab . It was far down the afternoon ; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done : and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both stilly died together ; then , such a sweetness and such plaintiveness , such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles , the Spanish land - breeze , wantonly turned sailor , had gone to sea , freighted with these vesper hymns . Soothed again , but only soothed to deeper gloom , Ahab , who had sterned off from the whale , sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil	l
be thine ?" " And who are hearsed that die on the sea ?" " But I said , old man , that ere thou couldst die on this voyage , two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America ." " Aye , aye ! a strange sight that , Parsee :-- a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall - bearers . Ha ! Such a sight we shall not soon see ." " Believe it or not , thou canst not die till it be seen , old man ." " And what was that saying about thyself ?" " Though it come to the last , I shall still go before thee thy pilot ." " And when thou art so gone before -- if that ever befall -- then ere I can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ?-- Was it not so ? Well , then , did I believe all ye say , oh my	l
; and as the ship half - wheeled upon her heel , her three firm - seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long , ribbed hull , seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed . Standing between the knight - heads , Starbuck watched the Pequod ' s tumultuous way , and Ahab ' s also , as he went lurching along the deck . " I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow , full of its tormented flaming life ; and I have seen it wane at last , down , down , to dumbest dust . Old man of oceans ! of all this fiery life of thine , what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes !" " Aye ," cried Stubb , " but sea - coal ashes -- mind ye that , Mr . Starbuck -- sea - coal , not your common charcoal . Well , well ; I heard Ahab mutter , ' Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine ; swears that I must play them , and no others .' And damn me	l
else , never mind how foolish ?" " Here !" cried Starbuck , seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , " markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick ? the very course he swung to this day noon ? now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ? In the stern - sheets , man ; where he is wont to stand -- his stand - point is stove , man ! Now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must ! " I don ' t half understand ye : what ' s in the wind ?" " Yes , yes , round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket ," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly , heedless of Stubb ' s question . " The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home . Yonder , to windward , all is blackness of doom ; but to leeward , homeward -- I see it	l
a torch among them ; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope ' s end . Petrified by his aspect , and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and Ahab again spoke :-- " All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old Ahab is bound . And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats ; look ye here ;	s
and stir nothing , but lash everything . The wind rises , but it has not got up to my table - lands yet . Quick , and see to it .-- By masts and keels ! he takes me for the hunch - backed skipper of some coasting smack . Send down my main - top - sail yard ! Ho , gluepots ! Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds , and this brain - truck of mine now sails amid the cloud - scud . Shall I strike that ? Oh , none but cowards send down	s
lucifers forward ; how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here ? Why , my little man , you have pretty red hair , but you couldn ' t get afire now . Shake yourself ; you ' re Aquarius , or the water - bearer , Flask ; might fill pitchers at your coat collar . Don ' t you see , then , that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees ? Here are hydrants , Flask . But hark , again , and I ' ll answer ye	s
so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again ; and the course -- for the present , East - south - east -- which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman . For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes . But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo ! a good sign ! the wind seemed coming round astern ; aye , the foul breeze became fair ! Instantly the yards were squared , to the lively song of " HO ! THE FAIR WIND ! OH - YE - HO , CHEERLY MEN !" the crew singing for joy , that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it . In compliance with the standing order of his commander -- to report immediately , and at any one of the twenty - four hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck ,-- Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze -- however reluctantly	l
for death and doom ,-- THAT ' S fair for Moby Dick . It ' s a fair wind that ' s only fair for that accursed fish .-- The very tube he pointed at me !-- the very one ; THIS one -- I hold it here ; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now .-- Aye and he would fain kill all his crew . Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ? and in these same perilous seas	s
whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill , in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses . Besides , the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles , though clumsily practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some shudderings and evil portents . " Men ," said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed him the things he had demanded , " my men , the thunder turned old	s
s murdered Innocents -- that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all transfixedly listening , like the carved Roman slave , while that wild cry remained within hearing . The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids , and shuddered ; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled . Yet the grey Manxman -- the oldest mariner of all -- declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men in the	s
' ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle , one of the Gallipagos , is cut by the Equator right in the middle . Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts yon old man , too , right in his middle . He ' s always under the Line -- fiery hot , I tell ye ! He ' s looking this way -- come , oakum ; quick . Here we go again . This wooden mallet is the cork , and I ' m the professor of musical glasses -- tap , tap !" ( AHAB TO HIMSELF .) " There ' s a sight ! There ' s a sound ! The grey - headed woodpecker tapping the hollow tree ! Blind and dumb might well be envied now . See ! that thing rests on two line - tubs , full of tow - lines . A most malicious wag , that fellow . Rat - tat ! So man ' s seconds tick ! Oh ! how immaterial are all materials ! What things real are there , but imponderable thoughts ? Here now ' s the very dreaded symbol of grim death ,	l
by a mere hap , made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life . A life - buoy of a coffin ! Does it go further ? Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is , after all , but an immortality - preserver ! I ' ll think of that . But no . So far gone am I in the dark side of earth , that its other side , the theoretic bright one , seems but uncertain twilight to me . Will ye never have done , Carpenter ,	s
watch -- he ' s so cursed anxious to get it back . Who ever heard of two pious whale - ships cruising after one missing whale - boat in the height of the whaling season ? See , Flask , only see how pale he looks -- pale in the very buttons of his eyes -- look -- it wasn ' t the coat -- it must have been the --" " My boy , my own boy is among them . For God ' s sake -- I beg , I conjure "-- here exclaimed the stranger Captain	s
other boat ' s crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity ; which was only solved for him by his chief mate ' s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale - ship in such emergencies , that is , when placed between jeopardized but divided boats , always to pick up the majority first .	s
; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW .) Lad , lad , I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now . The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him , yet would not have thee by him . There is that in thee , poor lad , which I feel too curing to my malady . Like cures like ; and for this hunt , my malady becomes my most desired health . Do thou abide below here , where they shall serve thee , as if thou wert the captain . Aye , lad , thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair ; another screw to it , thou must be ." " No , no , no ! ye have not a whole body , sir ; do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg ; only tread upon me , sir ; I ask no more , so I remain a part of ye ." " Oh ! spite of million villains , this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man !-- and a black ! and crazy !-- but methinks like	l
shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being ' s body . And that shadow was always hovering there . For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go below . He would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say -- We two watchmen never rest . Nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless Ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits ,-- the main - mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin - scuttle ,-- his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really	l
. He ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals ,-- breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew all gnarled , as unearthed roots of trees blown over , which still grow idly on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure . But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the Parsee ' s mystic watch was without intermission as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak -- one man to the other -- unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary . Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe - struck crew , they seemed pole - like asunder . If by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange . At times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; Ahab in his scuttle , the Parsee by the	l
nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the main - mast head , he received the two ends of the downward - reeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail . This done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo , Queequeg ,	s
prize . An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin ' s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon Tanaquil , his wife , declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome . But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good . Ahab ' s hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea . CHAPTER 131 The Pequod Meets The Delight . The intense Pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the life - buoy - coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably misnamed the Delight , was descried . As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling - ships , cross the quarter - deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats .	l
in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless God does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not I . By heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and Fate is the handspike . And all the time , lo ! that smiling sky , and this unsounded sea ! Look ! see yon Albicore ! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying - fish ? Where do murderers go , man ! Who ' s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ? But it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and the air smells now , as if it blew from a far - away meadow ; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes , Starbuck , and the mowers are sleeping among the new - mown hay . Sleeping ? Aye , toil we how	l
That night , in the mid - watch , when the old man -- as his wont at intervals -- stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot - hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship ' s dog will , in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle . He declared that a whale must be near . Soon that peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale , was palpable to all the watch ; nor was any mariner surprised when , after inspecting the compass , and then the dog - vane , and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , Ahab rapidly ordered the ship ' s course to be slightly altered , and the sail to be shortened . The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak , by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it , the polished metallic -	l
sir , that Captain Ahab did , and I cried out ," said Tashtego . " Not the same instant ; not the same -- no , the doubloon is mine , Fate reserved the doubloon for me . I only ; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first . There she blows !-- there she blows !-- there she blows ! There again !-- there again !" he cried , in long - drawn , lingering , methodic tones , attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale ' s visible jets . " He ' s going to sound ! In stunsails ! Down top - gallant - sails ! Stand by three boats . Mr . Starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship . Helm there ! Luff , luff a point ! So ; steady , man , steady ! There go flukes ! No , no ; only black water ! All ready the boats there ? Stand by , stand by ! Lower me , Mr . Starbuck ; lower , lower ,-- quick , quicker !" and he slid through the air to the deck	l
still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that ; helpless Ahab ' s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst . From the boat ' s fragmentary stern , Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end , could not succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves . For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale ' s aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever - contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them . And though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways , Ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape . With straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man ' s head . Meantime , from the beginning all this had	l
thistle the ass refused ; it pricked his mouth too keenly , sir ; ha ! ha !" " What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck ? Man , man ! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire ( and as mechanical ) I could swear thou wert a poltroon . Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck ." " Aye , sir ," said Starbuck drawing near , "' tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one ." " Omen ? omen ?-- the dictionary ! If the gods think to speak outright to man , they will honourably speak outright ; not shake their heads , and give an old wives ' darkling hint .-- Begone ! Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing ; Starbuck is Stubb reversed , and Stubb is Starbuck ; and ye two are all mankind ; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth , nor gods nor men his neighbors ! Cold , cold -- I shiver !-- How now ? Aloft there ! D ' ye see him ? Sing out for every spout	l
land . And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby ' s pulse ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude . But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman ' s allies ; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety - three leagues and a quarter from his port ? Inferable from these statements , are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of	l
; and by the stirring perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night ' s suspense ; the fixed , unfearing , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were bowled along . The wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race . They were one man , not thirty . For as	s
the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things -- oak , and maple , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp -- yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the individualities of the crew , this man ' s valor , that man ' s fear ; guilt and guiltiness , all varieties were welded into oneness , and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to . The rigging lived . The mast - heads , like the tops of tall palms , were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs . Clinging to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient wavings ; others , shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate . Ah ! how they still strove through that infinite	l
twisted -- corkscrewed in the mazes of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their bristling barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab ' s boat . Only one thing could be done . Seizing the boat - knife , he critically reached within -- through -- and then , without -- the rays of steel ; dragged in the line beyond , passed it , inboard , to the bowsman , and then , twice sundering the rope near the chocks -- dropped the intercepted fagot	s
of steel into the sea ; and was all fast again . That instant , the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines ; by so doing , irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf - beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round , like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch . While the two crews were yet circling in the waters , reaching out after the revolving line - tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial , twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up ; and while the old man ' s line -- now parting -- admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could	l
direction as he struck the surface -- involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a stray oar , bit of plank , the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea . But soon , as if satisfied that his work for that time was done , he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean , and trailing after him the intertangled lines , continued his leeward way at a traveller ' s methodic pace . As before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks . Some sprained shoulders , wrists , and ankles ; livid contusions ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; inextricable intricacies of	l
me something for a cane -- there , that shivered lance will do . Muster the men . Surely I have not seen him yet . By heaven it cannot be !-- missing ?-- quick ! call them all ." The old man ' s hinted thought was true . Upon mustering the company , the Parsee was not there . " The Parsee !" cried Stubb --" he must have been caught in --" " The black vomit wrench thee !-- run all of ye above , alow , cabin , forecastle -- find him -- not gone -- not gone !" But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found . " Aye , sir ," said Stubb --" caught among the tangles of your line -- I thought I saw him dragging under ." " MY line ! MY line ? Gone ?-- gone ? What means that little word ?-- What death - knell rings in it , that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry . The harpoon , too !-- toss over the litter there ,-- d ' ye see it ?-- the forged	l
I ' ll slay him yet ! " Great God ! but for one single instant show thyself ," cried Starbuck ; " never , never wilt thou capture him , old man -- In Jesus ' name no more of this , that ' s worse than devil ' s madness . Two days chased ; twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone -- all good angels mobbing thee with warnings :-- what more wouldst thou have ?-- Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man ? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ? Oh , oh ,-- Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more !" " Starbuck , of late I ' ve felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that hour we both saw -- thou know ' st what , in one another ' s eyes . But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand -- a	l
but Ahab ' s soul ' s a centipede , that moves upon a hundred legs . I feel strained , half stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale ; and I may look so . But ere I break , yell hear me crack ; and till ye hear THAT , know that Ahab ' s hawser tows his purpose yet . Believe ye , men , in the things called omens ? Then laugh aloud , and cry encore ! For ere they drown , drowning things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for evermore . So with Moby Dick -- two days he ' s floated -- tomorrow will be the third . Aye , men , he ' ll rise once more ,-- but only to spout his last ! D ' ye feel brave men , brave ?" " As fearless fire ," cried Stubb . " And as mechanical ," muttered Ahab . Then as the men went forward , he muttered on : " The things called omens ! And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there , concerning my broken	l
strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow . Even Ahab is a braver thing -- a nobler thing than THAT . Would now the wind but had a body ; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man , all these things are bodiless , but only bodiless as objects , not as agents . There ' s a most special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference ! And yet , I say again , and swear it now , that there ' s something all glorious and gracious in the wind . These warm Trade Winds , at least , that in the clear heavens blow straight on , in strong and steadfast , vigorous mildness ; and veer not from their mark , however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack , and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about , uncertain where to go at last . And by the eternal Poles ! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on ; these Trades , or something like them -- something so unchangeable ,	l
There ' s the difference now between man ' s old age and matter ' s . But aye , old mast , we both grow old together ; sound in our hulls , though , are we not , my ship ? Aye , minus a leg , that ' s all . By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way . I can ' t compare with it ; and I ' ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of	s
vital fathers . What ' s that he said ? he should still go before me , my pilot ; and yet to be seen again ? But where ? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea , supposing I descend those endless stairs ? and all night I ' ve been sailing from him , wherever he did sink to . Aye , aye , like many more thou told ' st direful truth as touching thyself , O Parsee ; but , Ahab , there thy shot fell short . Good - bye , mast - head -- keep a good eye upon the whale , the while I ' m gone . We ' ll talk to - morrow , nay , to - night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail ." He gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck . In due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his shallop ' s stern , Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to	l
waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles ; then quickly upheaved , as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice , swiftly rising to the surface . A low rumbling sound was heard ; a subterraneous hum ; and then all held their breaths ; as bedraggled with trailing ropes , and harpoons , and lances , a vast form shot lengthwise , but obliquely from the sea . Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist , it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air ; and then fell swamping back into the deep .	s
stopped . He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea . " Oh ! Ahab ," cried Starbuck , " not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist . See ! Moby Dick seeks thee not . It is thou , thou , that madly seekest him !" Setting sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas . And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel	s
of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost . For all that , I would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup ! Oh , oh ! oh , oh ! thou grinning whale , but there ' ll be plenty of gulping soon ! Why fly ye not , O Ahab ! For me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let Stubb die in his drawers ! A most mouldy and over salted death , though ;-- cherries ! cherries ! cherries ! Oh , Flask , for one	s
wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill , the submerged savage beneath , in his death - gasp , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with archangelic shrieks , and his imperial beak thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab , went down with his ship , which , like Satan , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it . Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all collapsed , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago . Epilogue " AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE " Job . The drama ' s done . Why then here does any one step forth ?-- Because one did survive the wreck . It so chanced , that after the Parsee ' s disappearance , I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab	l
Who , from the terror of this arm , so late Doubted his empire -- that were low indeed ; That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall ; since , by fate , the strength of Gods , And this empyreal sybstance , cannot fail ; Since , through experience of this great event , In arms not worse , in foresight much advanced , We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal war , Irreconcilable to our grand Foe , Who now triumphs , and in th ' excess of joy Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven ." So spake th ' apostate Angel , though in pain , Vaunting aloud , but racked with deep despair ; And him thus answered soon his bold compeer :-- " O Prince , O Chief of many throned Powers That led th ' embattled Seraphim to war Under thy conduct , and , in dreadful deeds Fearless , endangered Heaven ' s perpetual King , And put to proof his high supremacy , Whether upheld by strength , or chance , or fate , Too well I see and rue the dire	l
our Foe . Seest thou yon dreary plain , forlorn and wild , The seat of desolation , void of light , Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful ? Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves ; There rest , if any rest can harbour there ; And , re - assembling our afflicted powers , Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our enemy , our own loss how repair , How overcome this dire calamity , What reinforcement we may gain from hope , If not , what resolution from despair ." Thus Satan , talking to his nearest mate , With head uplift above the wave , and eyes That sparkling blazed ; his other parts besides Prone on the flood , extended long and large , Lay floating many a rood , in bulk as huge As whom the fables name of monstrous size , Titanian or Earth - born , that warred on Jove , Briareos or Typhon , whom the den By ancient Tarsus held , or that sea - beast Leviathan , which God of all his works Created hugest that swim	l
floating carcases And broken chariot - wheels . So thick bestrown , Abject and lost , lay these , covering the flood , Under amazement of their hideous change . He called so loud that all the hollow deep Of Hell resounded :--" Princes , Potentates , Warriors , the Flower of Heaven -- once yours ; now lost , If such astonishment as this can seize Eternal Spirits ! Or have ye chosen this place After the toil of battle to repose Your wearied virtue , for the ease you find To slumber here , as in the vales of Heaven ? Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conqueror , who now beholds Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood With scattered arms and ensigns , till anon His swift pursuers from Heaven - gates discern Th ' advantage , and , descending , tread us down Thus drooping , or with linked thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf ? Awake , arise , or be for ever fallen !" They heard , and were abashed , and up they sprung Upon the wing , as when men wont to watch	l
On duty , sleeping found by whom they dread , Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake . Nor did they not perceive the evil plight In which they were , or the fierce pains not feel ; Yet to their General ' s voice they soon obeyed Innumerable . As when the potent rod Of Amram ' s son , in Egypt ' s evil day , Waved round the coast , up - called a pitchy cloud Of locusts , warping on the eastern wind , That o ' er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night	s
: with them rose A forest huge of spears ; and thronging helms Appeared , and serried shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable . Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and soft recorders -- such as raised To height of noblest temper heroes old Arming to battle , and instead of rage Deliberate valour breathed , firm , and unmoved With dread of death to flight or foul retreat ; Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches troubled thoughts , and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds . Thus they , Breathing united force with fixed thought , Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed Their painful steps o ' er the burnt soil . And now Advanced in view they stand -- a horrid front Of dreadful length and dazzling arms , in guise Of warriors old , with ordered spear and shield , Awaiting what command their mighty Chief Had to impose . He through the armed files Darts his experienced eye , and soon traverse The whole battalion views -- their order due , Their visages	l
To speak ; whereat their doubled ranks they bend From wing to wing , and half enclose him round With all his peers : attention held them mute . Thrice he assayed , and thrice , in spite of scorn , Tears , such as Angels weep , burst forth : at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way :-- " O myriads of immortal Spirits ! O Powers Matchless , but with th ' Almighth !-- and that strife Was not inglorious , though th ' event was dire , As this place testifies , and this dire change , Hateful to utter . But what power of mind , Forseeing or presaging , from the depth Of knowledge past or present , could have feared How such united force of gods , how such As stood like these , could ever know repulse ? For who can yet believe , though after loss , That all these puissant legions , whose exile Hath emptied Heaven , shall fail to re - ascend , Self - raised , and repossess their native seat ? For me , be witness all the host of Heaven , If counsels	l
different , or danger shunned By me , have lost our hopes . But he who reigns Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure Sat on his throne , upheld by old repute , Consent or custom , and his regal state Put forth at full , but still his strength concealed -- Which tempted our attempt , and wrought our fall . Henceforth his might we know , and know our own , So as not either to provoke , or dread New war provoked : our better part remains To work in close design , by fraud	s
golden architrave ; nor did there want Cornice or frieze , with bossy sculptures graven ; The roof was fretted gold . Not Babylon Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equalled in all their glories , to enshrine Belus or Serapis their gods , or seat Their kings , when Egypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxury . Th ' ascending pile Stood fixed her stately height , and straight the doors , Opening their brazen folds , discover , wide Within , her ample spaces o ' er the smooth And level pavement : from the arched roof , Pendent by subtle magic , many a row Of starry lamps and blazing cressets , fed With naptha and asphaltus , yielded light As from a sky . The hasty multitude Admiring entered ; and the work some praise , And some the architect . His hand was known In Heaven by many a towered structure high , Where sceptred Angels held their residence , And sat as Princes , whom the supreme King Exalted to such power , and gave to rule , Each in his Hierarchy , the Orders bright . Nor was his name unheard or unadored	l
In ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land Men called him Mulciber ; and how he fell From Heaven they fabled , thrown by angry Jove Sheer o ' er the crystal battlements : from morn To noon he fell , from noon to dewy eve , A summer ' s day , and with the setting sun Dropt from the zenith , like a falling star , On Lemnos , th ' Aegaean isle . Thus they relate , Erring ; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before ; nor aught aviled him now To have built	s
of war . Ye have what I advise ." He scarce had finished , when such murmur filled Th ' assembly as when hollow rocks retain The sound of blustering winds , which all night long Had roused the sea , now with hoarse cadence lull Seafaring men o ' erwatched , whose bark by chance Or pinnace , anchors in a craggy bay After the tempest . Such applause was heard As Mammon ended , and his sentence pleased , Advising peace : for such another field They dreaded worse than Hell ; so much the fear Of thunder and the sword of Michael Wrought still within them ; and no less desire To found this nether empire , which might rise , By policy and long process of time , In emulation opposite to Heaven . Which when Beelzebub perceived -- than whom , Satan except , none higher sat -- with grave Aspect he rose , and in his rising seemed A pillar of state . Deep on his front engraven Deliberation sat , and public care ; And princely counsel in his face yet shone , Majestic , though in ruin . Sage he stood With	l
rejoice In doing what we most in suffering feel ? Nor will occasion want , nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heaven , whose high walls fear no assault or siege , Or ambush from the Deep . What if we find Some easier enterprise ? There is a place ( If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven Err not )-- another World , the happy seat Of some new race , called Man , about this time To be created like to us , though less In power and excellence , but favoured more Of him	s
relies ." This said , he sat ; and expectation held His look suspense , awaiting who appeared To second , or oppose , or undertake The perilous attempt . But all sat mute , Pondering the danger with deep thoughts ; and each In other ' s countenance read his own dismay , Astonished . None among the choice and prime Of those Heaven - warring champions could be found So hardy as to proffer or accept , Alone , the dreadful voyage ; till , at last , Satan , whom now transcendent glory raised Above his fellows , with monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth , unmoved thus spake :-- " O Progeny of Heaven ! Empyreal Thrones ! With reason hath deep silence and demur Seized us , though undismayed . Long is the way And hard , that out of Hell leads up to light . Our prison strong , this huge convex of fire , Outrageous to devour , immures us round Ninefold ; and gates of burning adamant , Barred over us , prohibit all egress . These passed , if any pass , the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next	l
Dreaded not more th ' adventure than his voice Forbidding ; and at once with him they rose . Their rising all at once was as the sound Of thunder heard remote . Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone , and as a God Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven . Nor failed they to express how much they praised That for the general safety he despised His own : for neither do the Spirits damned Lose all their virtue ; lest bad men should boast Their specious deeds on earth , which glory excites ,	s
Or close ambition varnished o ' er with zeal . Thus they their doubtful consultations dark Ended , rejoicing in their matchless Chief : As , when from mountain - tops the dusky clouds Ascending , while the north wind sleeps , o ' erspread Heaven ' s cheerful face , the louring element Scowls o ' er the darkened landscape snow or shower , If chance the radiant sun , with farewell sweet , Extend his evening beam , the fields revive , The birds their notes renew , and bleating herds Attest their joy , that hill and valley rings . O shame to men ! Devil with devil damned Firm concord holds ; men only disagree Of creatures rational , though under hope Of heavenly grace , and , God proclaiming peace , Yet live in hatred , enmity , and strife Among themselves , and levy cruel wars Wasting the earth , each other to destroy : As if ( which might induce us to accord ) Man had not hellish foes enow besides , That day and night for his destruction wait ! The Stygian council thus dissolved ; and forth In order came the	l
adn wide , and all the host of Hell With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim . Thence more at ease their minds , and somewhat raised By false presumptuous hope , the ranged Powers Disband ; and , wandering , each his several way Pursues , as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplexed , where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts , and entertain The irksome hours , till his great Chief return . Part on the plain , or in the air sublime , Upon the wing or in swift race contend , As at th ' Olympian games or Pythian fields ; Part curb their fiery steeds , or shun the goal With rapid wheels , or fronted brigades form : As when , to warn proud cities , war appears Waged in the troubled sky , and armies rush To battle in the clouds ; before each van Prick forth the airy knights , and couch their spears , Till thickest legions close ; with feats of arms From either end of heaven the welkin burns . Others , with vast Typhoean rage , more fell , Rend up both rocks and	l
hills , and ride the air In whirlwind ; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar :-- As when Alcides , from Oechalia crowned With conquest , felt th ' envenomed robe , and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines , And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th ' Euboic sea . Others , more mild , Retreated in a silent valley , sing With notes angelical to many a harp Their own heroic deeds , and hapless fall By doom of battle , and complain that Fate Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or	s
. About her middle round A cry of Hell - hounds never - ceasing barked With wide Cerberean mouths full loud , and rung A hideous peal ; yet , when they list , would creep , If aught disturbed their noise , into her womb , And kennel there ; yet there still barked and howled Within unseen . Far less abhorred than these Vexed Scylla , bathing in the sea that parts Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore ; Nor uglier follow the night - hag , when , called In secret , riding through the air she comes , Lured with the smell of infant blood , to dance With Lapland witches , while the labouring moon Eclipses at their charms . The other Shape -- If shape it might be called that shape had none Distinguishable in member , joint , or limb ; Or substance might be called that shadow seemed , For each seemed either -- black it stood as Night , Fierce as ten Furies , terrible as Hell , And shook a dreadful dart : what seemed his head The likeness of a kingly crown had on . Satan was now at	l
her words the hellish Pest Forbore : then these to her Satan returned :-- " So strange thy outcry , and thy words so strange Thou interposest , that my sudden hand , Prevented , spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends , till first I know of thee What thing thou art , thus double - formed , and why , In this infernal vale first met , thou call ' st Me father , and that phantasm call ' st my son . I know thee not , nor ever saw till now Sight more	s
the sands Of Barca or Cyrene ' s torrid soil , Levied to side with warring winds , and poise Their lighter wings . To whom these most adhere He rules a moment : Chaos umpire sits , And by decision more embroils the fray By which he reigns : next him , high arbiter , Chance governs all . Into this wild Abyss , The womb of Nature , and perhaps her grave , Of neither sea , nor shore , nor air , nor fire , But all these in their pregnant causes mixed Confusedly , and which thus must ever fight , Unless th ' Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more worlds -- Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while , Pondering his voyage ; for no narrow frith He had to cross . Nor was his ear less pealed With noises loud and ruinous ( to compare Great things with small ) than when Bellona storms With all her battering engines , bent to rase Some capital city ; or less than if this frame Of Heaven were falling , and these	l
elements In mutiny had from her axle torn The steadfast Earth . At last his sail - broad vans He spread for flight , and , in the surging smoke Uplifted , spurns the ground ; thence many a league , As in a cloudy chair , ascending rides Audacious ; but , that seat soon failing , meets A vast vacuity . All unawares , Fluttering his pennons vain , plumb - down he drops Ten thousand fathom deep , and to this hour Down had been falling , had not , by ill chance , The strong rebuff	s
alteration ! Sin and Death amain , Following his track ( such was the will of Heaven ) Paved after him a broad and beaten way Over the dark Abyss , whose boiling gulf Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length , From Hell continued , reaching th ' utmost orb Of this frail World ; by which the Spirits perverse With easy intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals , except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace . But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears , and from the walls	s
beam May I express thee unblam ' d ? since God is light , And never but in unapproached light Dwelt from eternity , dwelt then in thee Bright effluence of bright essence increate . Or hear " st thou rather pure ethereal stream , Whose fountain who shall tell ? before the sun , Before the Heavens thou wert , and at the voice Of God , as with a mantle , didst invest *** The rising world of waters dark and deep , Won from the void and formless infinite . Thee I re - visit now with	s
divine ; But cloud instead , and ever - during dark Surrounds me , from the cheerful ways of men Cut off , and for the book of knowledge fair Presented with a universal blank Of nature ' s works to me expung ' d and ras ' d , And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out . So much the rather thou , celestial Light , Shine inward , and the mind through all her powers Irradiate ; there plant eyes , all mist from thence Purge and disperse , that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight . Now had the Almighty Father from above , From the pure empyrean where he sits High thron ' d above all highth , bent down his eye His own works and their works at once to view : About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as stars , and from his sight receiv ' d Beatitude past utterance ; on his right The radiant image of his glory sat , His only son ; on earth he first beheld Our two first parents , yet the only two Of mankind in the happy	l
garden plac ' d Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love , Uninterrupted joy , unrivall ' d love , In blissful solitude ; he then survey ' d Hell and the gulf between , and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night In the dun air sublime , and ready now To stoop with wearied wings , and willing feet , On the bare outside of this world , that seem ' d Firm land imbosom ' d , without firmament , Uncertain which , in ocean or in air . Him God beholding from	s
his prospect high , Wherein past , present , future , he beholds , Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake . Only begotten Son , seest thou what rage Transports our Adversary ? whom no bounds Prescrib ' d no bars of Hell , nor all the chains Heap ' d on him there , nor yet the main abyss Wide interrupt , can hold ; so bent he seems On desperate revenge , that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head . And now , Through all restraint broke loose , he wings his way Not far off Heaven , in the precincts of light , Directly towards the new created world , And man there plac ' d , with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy , or , worse , By some false guile pervert ; and shall pervert ; For man will hearken to his glozing lies , And easily transgress the sole command , Sole pledge of his obedience : So will fall He and his faithless progeny : Whose fault ? Whose but his own ? ingrate , he had of me All he could have ; I made	l
reason ( reason also is choice ) Useless and vain , of freedom both despoil ' d , Made passive both , had serv ' d necessity , Not me ? they therefore , as to right belong $ ' d , So were created , nor can justly accuse Their Maker , or their making , or their fate , As if predestination over - rul ' d Their will dispos ' d by absolute decree Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed Their own revolt , not I ; if I foreknew , Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault , Which had no less proved certain unforeknown . So without least impulse or shadow of fate , Or aught by me immutably foreseen , They trespass , authors to themselves in all Both what they judge , and what they choose ; for so I form ' d them free : and free they must remain , Till they enthrall themselves ; I else must change Their nature , and revoke the high decree Unchangeable , eternal , which ordain ' d $ THeir freedom : they themselves ordain ' d their fall . The first sort by	l
their own suggestion fell , Self - tempted , self - deprav ' d : Man falls , deceiv ' d By the other first : Man therefore shall find grace , The other none : In mercy and justice both , Through Heaven and Earth , so shall my glory excel ; But Mercy , first and last , shall brightest shine . Thus while God spake , ambrosial fragrance fill ' d All Heaven , and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus ' d . Beyond compare the Son of God was seen	s
. To prayer , repentance , and obedience due , Though but endeavour ' d with sincere intent , Mine ear shall not be slow , mine eye not shut . And I will place within them as a guide , My umpire Conscience ; whom if they will hear , Light after light , well us ' d , they shall attain , And to the end , persisting , safe arrive . This my long sufferance , and my day of grace , They who neglect and scorn , shall never taste ; But hard be harden '	s
voices , uttering joy , Heaven rung With jubilee , and loud Hosannas filled The eternal regions : Lowly reverent Towards either throne they bow , and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold ; Immortal amarant , a flower which once In Paradise , fast by the tree of life , Began to bloom ; but soon for man ' s offence To Heaven removed , where first it grew , there grows , And flowers aloft shading the fount of life , And where the river of bliss through	s
, but with both wings veil their eyes . Thee next they sang of all creation first , Begotten Son , Divine Similitude , In whose conspicuous countenance , without cloud Made visible , the Almighty Father shines , Whom else no creature can behold ; on thee Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides , Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests . He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created ; and by thee threw down The aspiring Dominations : Thou that day Thy Father ' s dreadful thunder didst not spare , Nor	s
stop thy flaming chariot - wheels , that shook Heaven ' s everlasting frame , while o ' er the necks Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed . Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim Thee only extolled , Son of thy Father ' s might , To execute fierce vengeance on his foes , Not so on Man : Him through their malice fallen , Father of mercy and grace , thou didst not doom So strictly , but much more to pity incline : No sooner did thy dear and only Son Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man So strictly , but much more to pity inclined , He to appease thy wrath , and end the strife Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned , Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat Second to thee , offered himself to die For Man ' s offence . O unexampled love , Love no where to be found less than Divine ! Hail , Son of God , Saviour of Men ! Thy name Shall be the copious matter of my song Henceforth , and never shall my heart thy praise Forget , nor from	l
; Those argent fields more likely habitants , Translated Saints , or middle Spirits hold Betwixt the angelical and human kind . Hither of ill - joined sons and daughters born First from the ancient world those giants came With many a vain exploit , though then renowned : The builders next of Babel on the plain Of Sennaar , and still with vain design , New Babels , had they wherewithal , would build : Others came single ; he , who , to be deemed A God , leaped fondly into Aetna flames , Empedocles ; and he , who , to enjoy Plato ' s Elysium , leaped into the sea , Cleombrotus ; and many more too long , Embryos , and idiots , eremites , and friars White , black , and gray , with all their trumpery . Here pilgrims roam , that strayed so far to seek In Golgotha him dead , who lives in Heaven ; And they , who to be sure of Paradise , Dying , put on the weeds of Dominick , Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised ; They pass the planets seven , and pass the	l
lamp Turn swift their various motions , or are turned By his magnetick beam , that gently warms The universe , and to each inward part With gentle penetration , though unseen , Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep ; So wonderously was set his station bright . There lands the Fiend , a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the sun ' s lucent orb Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw . The place he found beyond expression bright , Compared with aught on earth , metal or stone ; Not all parts like , but	s
And here art likeliest by supreme decree Like honour to obtain , and as his eye To visit oft this new creation round ; Unspeakable desire to see , and know All these his wonderous works , but chiefly Man , His chief delight and favour , him for whom All these his works so wonderous he ordained , Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandering . Brightest Seraph , tell In which of all these shining orbs hath Man His fixed seat , or fixed seat hath none , But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell ; That I may find him , and with secret gaze Or open admiration him behold , On whom the great Creator hath bestowed Worlds , and on whom hath all these graces poured ; That both in him and all things , as is meet , The universal Maker we may praise ; Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes To deepest Hell , and , to repair that loss , Created this new happy race of Men To serve him better : Wise are all his ways . So spake the false dissembler unperceived	l
answer thus returned . Fair Angel , thy desire , which tends to know The works of God , thereby to glorify The great Work - master , leads to no excess That reaches blame , but rather merits praise The more it seems excess , that led thee hither From thy empyreal mansion thus alone , To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps , Contented with report , hear only in Heaven : For wonderful indeed are all his works , Pleasant to know , and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance always with delight ; But what created mind can comprehend Their number , or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth , but hid their causes deep ? I saw when at his word the formless mass , This world ' s material mould , came to a heap : Confusion heard his voice , and wild uproar Stood ruled , stood vast infinitude confined ; Till at his second bidding Darkness fled , Light shone , and order from disorder sprung : Swift to their several quarters hasted then The cumbrous elements , earth , flood , air , fire ; And this ethereal	l
inhabitants on earth ! that now , While time was , our first parents had been warned The coming of their secret foe , and ' scaped , Haply so ' scaped his mortal snare : For now Satan , now first inflamed with rage , came down , The tempter ere the accuser of mankind , To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss Of that first battle , and his flight to Hell : Yet , not rejoicing in his speed , though bold Far off and fearless , nor with cause to boast , Begins his dire	s
Of hill or highest wall , and sheer within Lights on his feet . As when a prowling wolf , Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey , Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve In hurdled cotes amid the field secure , Leaps o ' er the fence with ease into the fold : Or as a thief , bent to unhoard the cash Of some rich burgher , whose substantial doors , Cross - barred and bolted fast , fear no assault , In at the window climbs , or o ' er the tiles : So clomb this first grand thief into God ' s fold ; So since into his church lewd hirelings climb . Thence up he flew , and on the tree of life , The middle tree and highest there that grew , Sat like a cormorant ; yet not true life Thereby regained , but sat devising death To them who lived ; nor on the virtue thought Of that life - giving plant , but only used For prospect , what well used had been the pledge Of immortality . So little knows Any , but God alone	l
was this place A happy rural seat of various view ; Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm , Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true , If true , here only , and of delicious taste : Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb , were interposed , Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store , Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose : Another side , umbrageous grots and caves Of cool recess , o ' er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake , That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams . The birds their quire apply ; airs , vernal airs , Breathing the smell of field and grove , attune The trembling leaves , while universal Pan , Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance , Led on the eternal Spring .	l
Abassin kings their issue guard , Mount Amara , though this by some supposed True Paradise under the Ethiop line By Nilus ' head , enclosed with shining rock , A whole day ' s journey high , but wide remote From this Assyrian garden , where the Fiend Saw , undelighted , all delight , all kind Of living creatures , new to sight , and strange Two of far nobler shape , erect and tall , Godlike erect , with native honour clad In naked majesty seemed lords of all : And worthy seemed ; for in their looks divine The image of their glorious Maker shone , Truth , wisdom , sanctitude severe and pure , ( Severe , but in true filial freedom placed ,) Whence true authority in men ; though both Not equal , as their sex not equal seemed ; For contemplation he and valour formed ; For softness she and sweet attractive grace ; He for God only , she for God in him : His fair large front and eye sublime declared Absolute rule ; and hyacinthine locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustering , but not beneath his	l
sly , Insinuating , wove with Gordian twine His braided train , and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded ; others on the grass Couched , and now filled with pasture gazing sat , Or bedward ruminating ; for the sun , Declined , was hasting now with prone career To the ocean isles , and in the ascending scale Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose : When Satan still in gaze , as first he stood , Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad . O Hell ! what do mine eyes with grief behold ! Into our room of bliss thus high advanced Creatures of other mould , earth - born perhaps , Not Spirits , yet to heavenly Spirits bright Little inferiour ; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder , and could love , so lively shines In them divine resemblance , and such grace The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured . Ah ! gentle pair , ye little think how nigh Your change approaches , when all these delights Will vanish , and deliver ye to woe ; More woe , the more your taste is now of	l
might learn , By word or action marked . About them round A lion now he stalks with fiery glare ; Then as a tiger , who by chance hath spied In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play , Straight couches close , then , rising , changes oft His couchant watch , as one who chose his ground , Whence rushing , he might surest seize them both , Griped in each paw : when , Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech , Turned him , all ear to hear new utterance	s
the moon ' s resplendent globe , And starry pole : Thou also madest the night , Maker Omnipotent , and thou the day , Which we , in our appointed work employed , Have finished , happy in our mutual help And mutual love , the crown of all our bliss Ordained by thee ; and this delicious place For us too large , where thy abundance wants Partakers , and uncropt falls to the ground . But thou hast promised from us two a race To fill the earth , who shall with us extol Thy goodness infinite	s
, both when we wake , And when we seek , as now , thy gift of sleep . This said unanimous , and other rites Observing none , but adoration pure Which God likes best , into their inmost bower Handed they went ; and , eased the putting off These troublesome disguises which we wear , Straight side by side were laid ; nor turned , I ween , Adam from his fair spouse , nor Eve the rites Mysterious of connubial love refused : Whatever hypocrites austerely talk Of purity , and place , and innocence , Defaming as impure what God declares Pure , and commands to some , leaves free to all . Our Maker bids encrease ; who bids abstain But our Destroyer , foe to God and Man ? Hail , wedded Love , mysterious law , true source Of human offspring , sole propriety In Paradise of all things common else ! By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men Among the bestial herds to range ; by thee Founded in reason , loyal , just , and pure , Relations dear , and all the charities Of father , son ,	l
dance , or wanton mask , or midnight ball , Or serenate , which the starved lover sings To his proud fair , best quitted with disdain . These , lulled by nightingales , embracing slept , And on their naked limbs the flowery roof Showered roses , which the morn repaired . Sleep on , Blest pair ; and O ! yet happiest , if ye seek No happier state , and know to know no more . Now had night measured with her shadowy cone Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault , And from their ivory port the Cherubim , Forth issuing at the accustomed hour , stood armed To their night watches in warlike parade ; When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake . Uzziel , half these draw off , and coast the south With strictest watch ; these other wheel the north ; Our circuit meets full west . As flame they part , Half wheeling to the shield , half to the spear . From these , two strong and subtle Spirits he called That near him stood , and gave them thus in charge . Ithuriel and Zephon ,	l
sender , not the sent , Or all at once ; more glory will be won , Or less be lost . Thy fear , said Zephon bold , Will save us trial what the least can do Single against thee wicked , and thence weak . The Fiend replied not , overcome with rage ; But , like a proud steed reined , went haughty on , Champing his iron curb : To strive or fly He held it vain ; awe from above had quelled His heart , not else dismayed . Now drew they nigh The western	s
, and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss ! To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow . Gabriel ? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise , And such I held thee ; but this question asked Puts me in doubt . Lives there who loves his pain ! Who would not , finding way , break loose from Hell , Though thither doomed ! Thou wouldst thyself , no doubt And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain , where thou mightst hope to change Torment with ease , and soonest recompense Dole with	s
name , O sacred name of faithfulness profaned ! Faithful to whom ? to thy rebellious crew ? Army of Fiends , fit body to fit head . Was this your discipline and faith engaged , Your military obedience , to dissolve Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme ? And thou , sly hypocrite , who now wouldst seem Patron of liberty , who more than thou Once fawned , and cringed , and servily adored Heaven ' s awful Monarch ? wherefore , but in hope To dispossess him , and thyself to reign ? But mark what I	s
dreamed , If dreamed , not , as I oft am wont , of thee , Works of day past , or morrow ' s next design , But of offence and trouble , which my mind Knew never till this irksome night : Methought , Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk With gentle voice ; I thought it thine : It said , ' Why sleepest thou , Eve ? now is the pleasant time , ' The cool , the silent , save where silence yields ' To the night - warbling bird ,	s
that now awake ' Tunes sweetest his love - laboured song ; now reigns ' Full - orbed the moon , and with more pleasing light ' Shadowy sets off the face of things ; in vain , ' If none regard ; Heaven wakes with all his eyes , ' Whom to behold but thee , Nature ' s desire ? ' In whose sight all things joy , with ravishment ' Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze .' I rose as at thy call , but found thee not ; To find thee I directed then my walk ; And on , methought , alone I passed through ways That brought me on a sudden to the tree Of interdicted knowledge : fair it seemed , Much fairer to my fancy than by day : And , as I wondering looked , beside it stood One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven By us oft seen ; his dewy locks distilled Ambrosia ; on that tree he also gazed ; And ' O fair plant ,' said he , ' with fruit surcharged , ' Deigns none to ease thy load , and taste	l
consent to do . Be not disheartened then , nor cloud those looks , That wont to be more cheerful and serene , Than when fair morning first smiles on the world ; And let us to our fresh employments rise Among the groves , the fountains , and the flowers That open now their choisest bosomed smells , Reserved from night , and kept for thee in store . So cheered he his fair spouse , and she was cheered ; But silently a gentle tear let fall From either eye , and wiped them with her hair ;	s
, and ye that warble , as ye flow , Melodious murmurs , warbling tune his praise . Join voices , all ye living Souls : Ye Birds , That singing up to Heaven - gate ascend , Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise . Ye that in waters glide , and ye that walk The earth , and stately tread , or lowly creep ; Witness if I be silent , morn or even , To hill , or valley , fountain , or fresh shade , Made vocal by my song , and taught his praise . Hail , universal Lord , be bounteous still To give us only good ; and if the night Have gathered aught of evil , or concealed , Disperse it , as now light dispels the dark ! So prayed they innocent , and to their thoughts Firm peace recovered soon , and wonted calm . On to their morning ' s rural work they haste , Among sweet dews and flowers ; where any row Of fruit - trees over - woody reached too far Their pampered boughs , and needed hands to check Fruitless embraces :	l
small he sees , Not unconformed to other shining globes , Earth , and the garden of God , with cedars crowned Above all hills . As when by night the glass Of Galileo , less assured , observes Imagined lands and regions in the moon : Or pilot , from amidst the Cyclades Delos or Samos first appearing , kens A cloudy spot . Down thither prone in flight He speeds , and through the vast ethereal sky Sails between worlds and worlds , with steady wing Now on the polar winds , then with quick fan Winnows the buxom air ; till , within soar Of towering eagles , to all the fowls he seems A phoenix , gazed by all as that sole bird , When , to enshrine his reliques in the Sun ' s Bright temple , to Egyptian Thebes he flies . At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise He lights , and to his proper shape returns A Seraph winged : Six wings he wore , to shade His lineaments divine ; the pair that clad Each shoulder broad , came mantling o ' er his breast With regal ornament ; the	l
obedience then To him , or possibly his love desert , Who formed us from the dust and placed us here Full to the utmost measure of what bliss Human desires can seek or apprehend ? To whom the Angel . Son of Heaven and Earth , Attend ! That thou art happy , owe to God ; That thou continuest such , owe to thyself , That is , to thy obedience ; therein stand . This was that caution given thee ; be advised . God made thee perfect , not immutable ; And good he made thee	s
that God ' s own ear Listens delighted . Evening now approached , ( For we have also our evening and our morn , We ours for change delectable , not need ;) Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn Desirous ; all in circles as they stood , Tables are set , and on a sudden piled With Angels food , and rubied nectar flows In pearl , in diamond , and massy gold , Fruit of delicious vines , the growth of Heaven . On flowers reposed , and with fresh flowerets crowned , They eat , they drink , and in communion sweet Quaff immortality and joy , secure Of surfeit , where full measure only bounds Excess , before the all - bounteous King , who showered With copious hand , rejoicing in their joy . Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled From that high mount of God , whence light and shade Spring both , the face of brightest Heaven had changed To grateful twilight , ( for night comes not there In darker veil ,) and roseat dews disposed All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest ; Wide over all	l
commands , Who speedily through all the hierarchies Intends to pass triumphant , and give laws . So spake the false Arch - Angel , and infused Bad influence into the unwary breast Of his associate : He together calls , Or several one by one , the regent Powers , Under him Regent ; tells , as he was taught , That the Most High commanding , now ere night , Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven , The great hierarchal standard was to move ; Tells the suggested cause , and casts between Ambiguous words and jealousies , to sound Or taint integrity : But all obeyed The wonted signal , and superiour voice Of their great Potentate ; for great indeed His name , and high was his degree in Heaven ; His countenance , as the morning - star that guides The starry flock , allured them , and with lies Drew after him the third part of Heaven ' s host . Mean while the Eternal eye , whose sight discerns Abstrusest thoughts , from forth his holy mount , And from within the golden lamps that burn Nightly before him , saw without	l
To one , and to his image now proclaimed ? But what if better counsels might erect Our minds , and teach us to cast off this yoke ? Will ye submit your necks , and choose to bend The supple knee ? Ye will not , if I trust To know ye right , or if ye know yourselves Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before By none ; and if not equal all , yet free , Equally free ; for orders and degrees Jar not with liberty , but well consist . Who can in reason then	s
he is ; how far from thought To make us less , bent rather to exalt Our happy state , under one head more near United . But to grant it thee unjust , That equal over equals monarch reign : Thyself , though great and glorious , dost thou count , Or all angelick nature joined in one , Equal to him begotten Son ? by whom , As by his Word , the Mighty Father made All things , even thee ; and all the Spirits of Heaven By him created in their bright degrees , Crowned them with glory , and to their glory named Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers , Essential Powers ; nor by his reign obscured , But more illustrious made ; since he the head One of our number thus reduced becomes ; His laws our laws ; all honour to him done Returns our own . Cease then this impious rage , And tempt not these ; but hasten to appease The incensed Father , and the incensed Son , While pardon may be found in time besought . So spake the fervent Angel ; but his zeal	l
laws Will not be now vouchsafed ; other decrees Against thee are gone forth without recall ; That golden scepter , which thou didst reject , Is now an iron rod to bruise and break Thy disobedience . Well thou didst advise ; Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly These wicked tents devoted , lest the wrath Impendent , raging into sudden flame , Distinguish not : For soon expect to feel His thunder on thy head , devouring fire . Then who created thee lamenting learn , When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know .	s
veil the Heaven , though darkness there might well Seem twilight here : And now went forth the Morn Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold Empyreal ; from before her vanished Night , Shot through with orient beams ; when all the plain Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright , Chariots , and flaming arms , and fiery steeds , Reflecting blaze on blaze , first met his view : War he perceived , war in procinct ; and found Already known what he for news had thought To have reported : Gladly then he mixed Among those	s
horizon to the north appeared From skirt to skirt a fiery region , stretched In battailous aspect , and nearer view Bristled with upright beams innumerable Of rigid spears , and helmets thronged , and shields Various , with boastful argument portrayed , The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition ; for they weened That self - same day , by fight or by surprise , To win the mount of God , and on his throne To set the Envier of his state , the proud Aspirer ; but their thoughts proved fond and vain In	s
that contest and foul , When reason hath to deal with force , yet so Most reason is that reason overcome . So pondering , and from his armed peers Forth stepping opposite , half - way he met His daring foe , at this prevention more Incensed , and thus securely him defied . Proud , art thou met ? thy hope was to have reached The highth of thy aspiring unopposed , The throne of God unguarded , and his side Abandoned , at the terrour of thy power Or potent tongue : Fool ! not to think how vain Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms ; Who out of smallest things could , without end , Have raised incessant armies to defeat Thy folly ; or with solitary hand Reaching beyond all limit , at one blow , Unaided , could have finished thee , and whelmed Thy legions under darkness : But thou seest All are not of thy train ; there be , who faith Prefer , and piety to God , though then To thee not visible , when I alone Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent From all : My sect	l
Hell Thou fablest ; here however to dwell free , If not to reign : Mean while thy utmost force , And join him named Almighty to thy aid , I fly not , but have sought thee far and nigh . They ended parle , and both addressed for fight Unspeakable ; for who , though with the tongue Of Angels , can relate , or to what things Liken on earth conspicuous , that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike power ? for likest Gods they seemed , Stood they or moved , in stature , motion , arms , Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven . Now waved their fiery swords , and in the air Made horrid circles ; two broad suns their shields Blazed opposite , while Expectation stood In horrour : From each hand with speed retired , Where erst was thickest fight , the angelick throng , And left large field , unsafe within the wind Of such commotion ; such as , to set forth Great things by small , if , nature ' s concord broke , Among the constellations war were sprung , Two planets	l
Descending , and in half cut sheer ; nor staid , But with swift wheel reverse , deep entering , shared All his right side : Then Satan first knew pain , And writhed him to and fro convolved ; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Passed through him : But the ethereal substance closed , Not long divisible ; and from the gash A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed Sanguine , such as celestial Spirits may bleed , And all his armour stained , ere while so bright . Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run By Angels many and strong , who interposed Defence , while others bore him on their shields Back to his chariot , where it stood retired From off the files of war : There they him laid Gnashing for anguish , and despite , and shame , To find himself not matchless , and his pride Humbled by such rebuke , so far beneath His confidence to equal God in power . Yet soon he healed ; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part , not as frail man In entrails , heart of head ,	l
havock hewn , And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake . Deliverer from new Lords , leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods ; yet hard For Gods , and too unequal work we find , Against unequal arms to fight in pain , Against unpained , impassive ; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue ; for what avails Valour or strength , though matchless , quelled with pain Which all subdues , and makes remiss the hands Of mightiest ? Sense of pleasure we may well Spare out of life perhaps , and not repine ,	s
And to disordered rage let loose the reins With mountains , as with weapons , armed ; which makes Wild work in Heaven , and dangerous to the main . Two days are therefore past , the third is thine ; For thee I have ordained it ; and thus far Have suffered , that the glory may be thine Of ending this great war , since none but Thou Can end it . Into thee such virtue and grace Immense I have transfused , that all may know In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare ; And , this perverse commotion governed thus , To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things ; to be Heir , and to be King By sacred unction , thy deserved right . Go then , Thou Mightiest , in thy Father ' s might ; Ascend my chariot , guide the rapid wheels That shake Heaven ' s basis , bring forth all my war , My bow and thunder , my almighty arms Gird on , and sword upon thy puissant thigh ; Pursue these sons of darkness , drive them out From all Heaven ' s bounds	l
where he sat ; And the third sacred morn began to shine , Dawning through Heaven . Forth rushed with whirlwind sound The chariot of Paternal Deity , Flashing thick flames , wheel within wheel undrawn , Itself instinct with Spirit , but convoyed By four Cherubick shapes ; four faces each Had wonderous ; as with stars , their bodies all And wings were set with eyes ; with eyes the wheels Of beryl , and careering fires between ; Over their heads a crystal firmament , Whereon a sapphire throne , inlaid with pure Amber , and colours	s
So fail not thou , who thee implores : For thou art heavenly , she an empty dream . Say , Goddess , what ensued when Raphael , The affable Arch - Angel , had forewarned Adam , by dire example , to beware Apostasy , by what befel in Heaven To those apostates ; lest the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his race , Charged not to touch the interdicted tree , If they transgress , and slight that sole command , So easily obeyed amid the choice Of all tastes else to please their appetite ,	s
forthwith Light Ethereal , first of things , quintessence pure , Sprung from the deep ; and from her native east To journey through the aery gloom began , Sphered in a radiant cloud , for yet the sun Was not ; she in a cloudy tabernacle Sojourned the while . God saw the light was good ; And light from darkness by the hemisphere Divided : light the Day , and darkness Night , He named . Thus was the first day even and morn : Nor past uncelebrated , nor unsung By the celestial quires , when orient	s
mole Rising , the crumbled earth above them threw In hillocks : The swift stag from under ground Bore up his branching head : Scarce from his mould Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved His vastness : Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose , As plants : Ambiguous between sea and land The river - horse , and scaly crocodile . At once came forth whatever creeps the ground , Insect or worm : those waved their limber fans For wings , and smallest lineaments exact In all the liveries decked of summer ' s pride With spots of gold	s
the day thou eatest , thou diest ; Death is the penalty imposed ; beware , And govern well thy appetite ; lest Sin Surprise thee , and her black attendant Death . Here finished he , and all that he had made Viewed , and behold all was entirely good ; So even and morn accomplished the sixth day : Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting , though unwearied , up returned , Up to the Heaven of Heavens , his high abode ; Thence to behold this new created world , The addition of his empire , how it showed In prospect from his throne , how good , how fair , Answering his great idea . Up he rode Followed with acclamation , and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand harps , that tuned Angelick harmonies : The earth , the air Resounded , ( thou rememberest , for thou heardst ,) The heavens and all the constellations rung , The planets in their station listening stood , While the bright pomp ascended jubilant . Open , ye everlasting gates ! they sung , Open , ye Heavens ! your living doors ; let	l
And shun the bitter consequence : for know , ' The day thou eatest thereof , my sole command ' Transgressed , inevitably thou shalt die , ' From that day mortal ; and this happy state ' Shalt lose , expelled from hence into a world ' Of woe and sorrow .' Sternly he pronounced The rigid interdiction , which resounds Yet dreadful in mine ear , though in my choice Not to incur ; but soon his clear aspect Returned , and gracious purpose thus renewed . ' Not only these fair bounds , but all the Earth ' To thee and to thy race I give ; as lords ' Possess it , and all things that therein live , ' Or live in sea , or air ; beast , fish , and fowl . ' In sign whereof , each bird and beast behold ' After their kinds ; I bring them to receive ' From thee their names , and pay thee fealty ' With low subjection ; understand the same ' Of fish within their watery residence , ' Not hither summoned , since they cannot change ' Their element , to draw	l
the thinner air .' As thus he spake , each bird and beast behold Approaching two and two ; these cowering low With blandishment ; each bird stooped on his wing . I named them , as they passed , and understood Their nature , with such knowledge God endued My sudden apprehension : But in these I found not what methought I wanted still ; And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed . O , by what name , for thou above all these , Above mankind , or aught than mankind higher , Surpassest far my naming ;	s
Abstract as in a trance , methought I saw , Though sleeping , where I lay , and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood : Who stooping opened my left side , and took From thence a rib , with cordial spirits warm , And life - blood streaming fresh ; wide was the wound , But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed : The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands ; Under his forming hands a creature grew , Man - like , but different sex ; so lovely fair , That what seemed fair in all the world , seemed now Mean , or in her summed up , in her contained And in her looks ; which from that time infused Sweetness into my heart , unfelt before , And into all things from her air inspired The spirit of love and amorous delight . She disappeared , and left me dark ; I waked To find her , or for ever to deplore Her loss , and other pleasures all abjure : When out of hope , behold her , not far off , Such as I saw her	l
; Joyous the birds ; fresh gales and gentle airs Whispered it to the woods , and from their wings Flung rose , flung odours from the spicy shrub , Disporting , till the amorous bird of night Sung spousal , and bid haste the evening - star On his hill top , to light the bridal lamp . Thus have I told thee all my state , and brought My story to the sum of earthly bliss , Which I enjoy ; and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed , but such As , used	s
, so well to know Her own , that what she wills to do or say , Seems wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best : All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded ; Wisdom in discourse with her Loses discountenanced , and like Folly shows ; Authority and Reason on her wait , As one intended first , not after made Occasionally ; and , to consummate all , Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat Build in her loveliest , and create an awe About her , as a guard angelick placed . To whom the Angel	s
in carnal pleasure ; for which cause , Among the beasts no mate for thee was found . To whom thus , half abashed , Adam replied . Neither her outside formed so fair , nor aught In procreation common to all kinds , ( Though higher of the genial bed by far , And with mysterious reverence I deem ,) So much delights me , as those graceful acts , Those thousand decencies , that daily flow From all her words and actions mixed with love And sweet compliance , which declare unfeigned Union of mind , or in us both one soul ; Harmony to behold in wedded pair More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear . Yet these subject not ; I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel , not therefore foiled , Who meet with various objects , from the sense Variously representing ; yet , still free , Approve the best , and follow what I approve . To love , thou blamest me not ; for Love , thou sayest , Leads up to Heaven , is both the way and guide ; Bear with me then , if lawful what	l
, The space of seven continued nights he rode With darkness ; thrice the equinoctial line He circled ; four times crossed the car of night From pole to pole , traversing each colure ; On the eighth returned ; and , on the coast averse From entrance or Cherubick watch , by stealth Found unsuspected way . There was a place , Now not , though sin , not time , first wrought the change , Where Tigris , at the foot of Paradise , Into a gulf shot under ground , till part Rose up a fountain by	s
the tree of life : In with the river sunk , and with it rose Satan , involved in rising mist ; then sought Where to lie hid ; sea he had searched , and land , From Eden over Pontus and the pool Maeotis , up beyond the river Ob ; Downward as far antarctick ; and in length , West from Orontes to the ocean barred At Darien ; thence to the land where flows Ganges and Indus : Thus the orb he roamed With narrow search ; and with inspection deep Considered every creature , which of all Most opportune might serve his wiles ; and found The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field . Him after long debate , irresolute Of thoughts revolved , his final sentence chose Fit vessel , fittest imp of fraud , in whom To enter , and his dark suggestions hide From sharpest sight : for , in the wily snake Whatever sleights , none would suspicious mark , As from his wit and native subtlety Proceeding ; which , in other beasts observed , Doubt might beget of diabolick power Active within , beyond the sense of brute .	l
the approach of morn . Now , when as sacred light began to dawn In Eden on the humid flowers , that breathed Their morning incense , when all things , that breathe , From the Earth ' s great altar send up silent praise To the Creator , and his nostrils fill With grateful smell , forth came the human pair , And joined their vocal worship to the quire Of creatures wanting voice ; that done , partake The season prime for sweetest scents and airs : Then commune , how that day they best may ply Their	s
shame By sly assault ; and somewhere nigh at hand Watches , no doubt , with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage , us asunder ; Hopeless to circumvent us joined , where each To other speedy aid might lend at need : Whether his first design be to withdraw Our fealty from God , or to disturb Conjugal love , than which perhaps no bliss Enjoyed by us excites his envy more ; Or this , or worse , leave not the faithful side That gave thee being , still shades thee , and protects .	s
- like step , fair virgin pass , What pleasing seemed , for her now pleases more ; She most , and in her look sums all delight : Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold This flowery plat , the sweet recess of Eve Thus early , thus alone : Her heavenly form Angelick , but more soft , and feminine , Her graceful innocence , her every air Of gesture , or least action , overawed His malice , and with rapine sweet bereaved His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought : That space the Evil -	s
Heroick built , though of terrestrial mould ; Foe not informidable ! exempt from wound , I not ; so much hath Hell debased , and pain Enfeebled me , to what I was in Heaven . She fair , divinely fair , fit love for Gods ! Not terrible , though terrour be in love And beauty , not approached by stronger hate , Hate stronger , under show of love well feigned ; The way which to her ruin now I tend . So spake the enemy of mankind , enclosed In serpent , inmate bad ! and	s
toward Eve Addressed his way : not with indented wave , Prone on the ground , as since ; but on his rear , Circular base of rising folds , that towered Fold above fold , a surging maze ! his head Crested aloft , and carbuncle his eyes ; With burnished neck of verdant gold , erect Amidst his circling spires , that on the grass Floated redundant : pleasing was his shape And lovely ; never since of serpent - kind Lovelier , not those that in Illyria changed , Hermione and Cadmus , or the god In Epidaurus ; nor to which transformed Ammonian Jove , or Capitoline , was seen ; He with Olympias ; this with her who bore Scipio , the highth of Rome . With tract oblique At first , as one who sought access , but feared To interrupt , side - long he works his way . As when a ship , by skilful steersmen wrought Nigh river ' s mouth or foreland , where the wind Veers oft , as oft so steers , and shifts her sail : So varied he , and of his tortuous train Curled many	l
at length The eye of Eve to mark his play ; he , glad Of her attention gained , with serpent - tongue Organick , or impulse of vocal air , His fraudulent temptation thus began . Wonder not , sovran Mistress , if perhaps Thou canst , who art sole wonder ! much less arm Thy looks , the Heaven of mildness , with disdain , Displeased that I approach thee thus , and gaze Insatiate ; I thus single ; nor have feared Thy awful brow , more awful thus retired . Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair , Thee all things living gaze on , all things thine By gift , and thy celestial beauty adore With ravishment beheld ! there best beheld , Where universally admired ; but here In this enclosure wild , these beasts among , Beholders rude , and shallow to discern Half what in thee is fair , one man except , Who sees thee ? and what is one ? who should be seen A Goddess among Gods , adored and served By Angels numberless , thy daily train . So glozed the Tempter , and his proem tuned : Into	l
have spared our coming hither , Fruitless to me , though fruit be here to excess , The credit of whose virtue rest with thee ; Wonderous indeed , if cause of such effects . But of this tree we may not taste nor touch ; God so commanded , and left that command Sole daughter of his voice ; the rest , we live Law to ourselves ; our reason is our law . To whom the Tempter guilefully replied . Indeed ! hath God then said that of the fruit Of all these garden - trees ye shall	s
up grown , The Tempter , all impassioned , thus began . O sacred , wise , and wisdom - giving Plant , Mother of science ! now I feel thy power Within me clear ; not only to discern Things in their causes , but to trace the ways Of highest agents , deemed however wise . Queen of this universe ! do not believe Those rigid threats of death : ye shall not die : How should you ? by the fruit ? it gives you life To knowledge ; by the threatener ? look on me ,	s
Me , who have touched and tasted ; yet both live , And life more perfect have attained than Fate Meant me , by venturing higher than my lot . Shall that be shut to Man , which to the Beast Is open ? or will God incense his ire For such a petty trespass ? and not praise Rather your dauntless virtue , whom the pain Of death denounced , whatever thing death be , Deterred not from achieving what might lead To happier life , knowledge of good and evil ; Of good , how just ? of evil , if what is evil Be real , why not known , since easier shunned ? God therefore cannot hurt ye , and be just ; Not just , not God ; not feared then , nor obeyed : Your fear itself of death removes the fear . Why then was this forbid ? Why , but to awe ; Why , but to keep ye low and ignorant , His worshippers ? He knows that in the day Ye eat thereof , your eyes that seem so clear , Yet are but dim , shall perfectly be then	l
participating God - like food ? The Gods are first , and that advantage use On our belief , that all from them proceeds : I question it ; for this fair earth I see , Warmed by the sun , producing every kind ; Them , nothing : if they all things , who enclosed Knowledge of good and evil in this tree , That whoso eats thereof , forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave ? and wherein lies The offence , that Man should thus attain to know ? What can your knowledge hurt him , or this tree Impart against his will , if all be his ? Or is it envy ? and can envy dwell In heavenly breasts ? These , these , and many more Causes import your need of this fair fruit . Goddess humane , reach then , and freely taste ! He ended ; and his words , replete with guile , Into her heart too easy entrance won : Fixed on the fruit she gazed , which to behold Might tempt alone ; and in her ears the sound Yet rung of his persuasive words , impregned With reason ,	l
and taught The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise : Thy praise he also , who forbids thy use , Conceals not from us , naming thee the tree Of knowledge , knowledge both of good and evil ; Forbids us then to taste ! but his forbidding Commends thee more , while it infers the good By thee communicated , and our want : For good unknown sure is not had ; or , had And yet unknown , is as not had at all . In plain then , what forbids he but to know , Forbids us good , forbids us to be wise ? Such prohibitions bind not . But , if death Bind us with after - bands , what profits then Our inward freedom ? In the day we eat Of this fair fruit , our doom is , we shall die ! How dies the Serpent ? he hath eaten and lives , And knows , and speaks , and reasons , and discerns , Irrational till then . For us alone Was death invented ? or to us denied This intellectual food , for beasts reserved ? For beasts	l
, Shall tend thee , and the fertile burden ease Of thy full branches offered free to all ; Till , dieted by thee , I grow mature In knowledge , as the Gods , who all things know ; Though others envy what they cannot give : For , had the gift been theirs , it had not here Thus grown . Experience , next , to thee I owe , Best guide ; not following thee , I had remained In ignorance ; thou openest wisdom ' s way , And givest access , though secret she retire	s
that with him all deaths I could endure , without him live no life . So saying , from the tree her step she turned ; But first low reverence done , as to the Power That dwelt within , whose presence had infused Into the plant sciential sap , derived From nectar , drink of Gods . Adam the while , Waiting desirous her return , had wove Of choicest flowers a garland , to adorn Her tresses , and her rural labours crown ; As reapers oft are wont their harvest - queen . Great joy he promised	s
head with verdant roof imbowered , He led her nothing loth ; flowers were the couch , Pansies , and violets , and asphodel , And hyacinth ; Earth ' s freshest softest lap . There they their fill of love and love ' s disport Took largely , of their mutual guilt the seal , The solace of their sin ; till dewy sleep Oppressed them , wearied with their amorous play , Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit , That with exhilarating vapour bland About their spirits had played , and inmost powers Made err , was now exhaled ; and grosser sleep , Bred of unkindly fumes , with conscious dreams Incumbered , now had left them ; up they rose As from unrest ; and , each the other viewing , Soon found their eyes how opened , and their minds How darkened ; innocence , that as a veil Had shadowed them from knowing ill , was gone ; Just confidence , and native righteousness , And honour , from about them , naked left To guilty Shame ; he covered , but his robe Uncovered more . So rose the Danite strong	l
, Herculean Samson , from the harlot - lap Of Philistean Dalilah , and waked Shorn of his strength . They destitute and bare Of all their virtue : Silent , and in face Confounded , long they sat , as strucken mute : Till Adam , though not less than Eve abashed , At length gave utterance to these words constrained . O Eve , in evil hour thou didst give ear To that false worm , of whomsoever taught To counterfeit Man ' s voice ; true in our fall , False in our promised rising ; since	s
lost , not I ; Who might have lived , and joyed immortal bliss , Yet willingly chose rather death with thee ? And am I now upbraided as the cause Of thy transgressing ? Not enough severe , It seems , in thy restraint : What could I more I warned thee , I admonished thee , foretold The danger , and the lurking enemy That lay in wait ; beyond this , had been force ; And force upon free will hath here no place . But confidence then bore thee on ; secure Either to meet no danger , or to find Matter of glorious trial ; and perhaps I also erred , in overmuch admiring What seemed in thee so perfect , that I thought No evil durst attempt thee ; but I rue The errour now , which is become my crime , And thou the accuser . Thus it shall befall Him , who , to worth in women overtrusting , Lets her will rule : restraint she will not brook ; And , left to herself , if evil thence ensue , She first his weak indulgence will accuse . Thus they in	l
lies Against his Maker ; no decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his fall , Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free will , to her own inclining left In even scale . But fallen he is ; and now What rests , but that the mortal sentence pass On his transgression ,-- death denounced that day ? Which he presumes already vain and void , Because not yet inflicted , as he feared , By some immediate stroke ; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance , ere day end . Justice shall not return as bounty scorned . But whom send I to judge them ? whom but thee , Vicegerent Son ? To thee I have transferred All judgement , whether in Heaven , or Earth , or Hell . Easy it may be seen that I intend Mercy colleague with justice , sending thee Man ' s friend , his Mediator , his designed Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary , And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen . So spake the Father ; and , unfolding bright Toward the right hand his glory , on the Son Blazed forth unclouded Deity : He	l
Now walking in the garden , by soft winds Brought to their ears , while day declined ; they heard , And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest trees , both man and wife ; till God , Approaching , thus to Adam called aloud . Where art thou , Adam , wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off ? I miss thee here , Not pleased , thus entertained with solitude , Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought : Or come I less conspicuous , or what change Absents thee , or what	s
hence , for intercourse , Or transmigration , as their lot shall lead . Nor can I miss the way , so strongly drawn By this new - felt attraction and instinct . Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon . Go , whither Fate , and inclination strong , Leads thee ; I shall not lag behind , nor err The way , thou leading ; such a scent I draw Of carnage , prey innumerable , and taste The savour of death from all things there that live : Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest Be	s
but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them , terrified He fled ; not hoping to escape , but shun The present ; fearing , guilty , what his wrath Might suddenly inflict ; that past , returned By night , and listening where the hapless pair Sat in their sad discourse , and various plaint , Thence gathered his own doom ; which understood Not instant , but of future time , with joy And tidings fraught , to Hell he now returned ; And at the brink of Chaos , near the foot Of this new wonderous pontifice , unhoped Met , who to meet him came , his offspring dear . Great joy was at their meeting , and at sight Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased . Long he admiring stood , till Sin , his fair Enchanting daughter , thus the silence broke . O Parent , these are thy magnifick deeds , Thy trophies ! which thou viewest as not thine own ; Thou art their author , and prime architect : For I no sooner in my heart divined , My heart , which by a secret harmony	l
, Hell and this world , one realm , one continent Of easy thorough - fare . Therefore , while I Descend through darkness , on your road with ease , To my associate Powers , them to acquaint With these successes , and with them rejoice ; You two this way , among these numerous orbs , All yours , right down to Paradise descend ; There dwell , and reign in bliss ; thence on the earth Dominion exercise and in the air , Chiefly on Man , sole lord of all declared ; Him first make sure	s
Hydrus , and Elops drear , And Dipsas ; ( not so thick swarmed once the soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon , or the isle Ophiusa ,) but still greatest he the midst , Now Dragon grown , larger than whom the sun Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime , Huge Python , and his power no less he seemed Above the rest still to retain ; they all Him followed , issuing forth to the open field , Where all yet left of that revolted rout , Heaven - fallen , in station stood or just array	s
To stuff this maw , this vast unhide - bound corps . To whom the incestuous mother thus replied . Thou therefore on these herbs , and fruits , and flowers , Feed first ; on each beast next , and fish , and fowl ; No homely morsels ! and , whatever thing The sithe of Time mows down , devour unspared ; Till I , in Man residing , through the race , His thoughts , his looks , words , actions , all infect ; And season him thy last and sweetest prey . This said , they both betook them several ways , Both to destroy , or unimmortal make All kinds , and for destruction to mature Sooner or later ; which the Almighty seeing , From his transcendent seat the Saints among , To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice . See , with what heat these dogs of Hell advance To waste and havock yonder world , which I So fair and good created ; and had still Kept in that state , had not the folly of Man Let in these wasteful furies , who impute Folly to me ; so	l
the snow From cold Estotiland , and south as far Beneath Magellan . At that tasted fruit The sun , as from Thyestean banquet , turned His course intended ; else , how had the world Inhabited , though sinless , more than now , Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat ? These changes in the Heavens , though slow , produced Like change on sea and land ; sideral blast , Vapour , and mist , and exhalation hot , Corrupt and pestilent : Now from the north Of Norumbega , and the Samoed shore , Bursting their brazen	s
dungeon , armed with ice , And snow , and hail , and stormy gust and flaw , Boreas , and Caecias , and Argestes loud , And Thrascias , rend the woods , and seas upturn ; With adverse blast upturns them from the south Notus , and Afer black with thunderous clouds From Serraliona ; thwart of these , as fierce , Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds , Eurus and Zephyr , with their lateral noise , Sirocco and Libecchio . Thus began Outrage from lifeless things ; but Discord first , Daughter of Sin , among the irrational Death introduced , through fierce antipathy : Beast now with beast ' gan war , and fowl with fowl , And fish with fish ; to graze the herb all leaving , Devoured each other ; nor stood much in awe Of Man , but fled him ; or , with countenance grim , Glared on him passing . These were from without The growing miseries , which Adam saw Already in part , though hid in gloomiest shade , To sorrow abandoned , but worse felt within ; And , in a troubled sea of	l
Will he draw out , For anger ' s sake , finite to infinite , In punished Man , to satisfy his rigour , Satisfied never ? That were to extend His sentence beyond dust and Nature ' s law ; By which all causes else , according still To the reception of their matter , act ; Not to the extent of their own sphere . But say That death be not one stroke , as I supposed , Bereaving sense , but endless misery From this day onward ; which I feel begun Both in me , and	s
God and thee ; And to the place of judgement will return , There with my cries importune Heaven ; that all The sentence , from thy head removed , may light On me , sole cause to thee of all this woe ; Me , me only , just object of his ire ! She ended weeping ; and her lowly plight , Immoveable , till peace obtained from fault Acknowledged and deplored , in Adam wrought Commiseration : Soon his heart relented Towards her , his life so late , and sole delight , Now at his feet	s
present object languishing With like desire ; which would be misery And torment less than none of what we dread ; Then , both ourselves and seed at once to free From what we fear for both , let us make short , -- Let us seek Death ; -- or , he not found , supply With our own hands his office on ourselves : Why stand we longer shivering under fears , That show no end but death , and have the power , Of many ways to die the shortest choosing , Destruction with destruction to destroy	s
my merit those Shall perfect , and for these my death shall pay . Accept me ; and , in me , from these receive The smell of peace toward mankind : let him live Before thee reconciled , at least his days Numbered , though sad ; till death , his doom , ( which I To mitigate thus plead , not to reverse ,) To better life shall yield him : where with me All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss ; Made one with me , as I with thee am one . To whom the Father , without cloud , serene . All thy request for Man , accepted Son , Obtain ; all thy request was my decree : But , longer in that Paradise to dwell , The law I gave to Nature him forbids : Those pure immortal elements , that know , No gross , no unharmonious mixture foul , Eject him , tainted now ; and purge him off , As a distemper , gross , to air as gross , And mortal food ; as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by sin , that first Distempered	l
behest have thou in charge ; Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming warriours , lest the Fiend , Or in behalf of Man , or to invade Vacant possession , some new trouble raise : Haste thee , and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful pair ; From hallowed ground the unholy ; and denounce To them , and to their progeny , from thence Perpetual banishment . Yet , lest they faint At the sad sentence rigorously urged , ( For I behold them softened , and with tears Bewailing their excess ,) all terrour hide . If patiently thy bidding they obey , Dismiss them not disconsolate ; reveal To Adam what shall come in future days , As I shall thee enlighten ; intermix My covenant in the Woman ' s seed renewed ; So send them forth , though sorrowing , yet in peace : And on the east side of the garden place , Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs , Cherubick watch ; and of a sword the flame Wide - waving ; all approach far off to fright , And guard all	l
to warn Us , haply too secure , of our discharge From penalty , because from death released Some days : how long , and what till then our life , Who knows ? or more than this , that we are dust , And thither must return , and be no more ? Why else this double object in our sight Of flight pursued in the air , and o ' er the ground , One way the self - same hour ? why in the east Darkness ere day ' s mid - course , and morning - light More orient in yon western cloud , that draws O ' er the blue firmament a radiant white , And slow descends with something heavenly fraught ? He erred not ; for by this the heavenly bands Down from a sky of jasper lighted now In Paradise , and on a hill made halt ; A glorious apparition , had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam ' s eye . Not that more glorious , when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim , where he saw The field pavilioned with his guardians bright ; Nor that	l
it forth : Therefore to his great bidding I submit . This most afflicts me , that , departing hence , As from his face I shall be hid , deprived His blessed countenance : Here I could frequent With worship place by place where he vouchsafed Presence Divine ; and to my sons relate , ' On this mount he appeared ; under this tree ' Stood visible ; among these pines his voice ' I heard ; here with him at this fountain talked : So many grateful altars I would rear Of grassy turf , and pile	s
up every stone Of lustre from the brook , in memory , Or monument to ages ; and theron Offer sweet - smelling gums , and fruits , and flowers : In yonder nether world where shall I seek His bright appearances , or foot - step trace ? For though I fled him angry , yet recalled To life prolonged and promised race , I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory ; and far off his steps adore . To whom thus Michael with regard benign . Adam , thou knowest Heaven his , and all the Earth ; Not this rock only ; his Omnipresence fills Land , sea , and air , and every kind that lives , Fomented by his virtual power and warmed : All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule , No despicable gift ; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confined Of Paradise , or Eden : this had been Perhaps thy capital seat , from whence had spread All generations ; and had hither come From all the ends of the earth , to celebrate And reverence thee , their great progenitor	l
which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear ; that thou mayest know What misery the inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on Men . Immediately a place Before his eyes appeared , sad , noisome , dark ; A lazar - house it seemed ; wherein were laid Numbers of all diseased ; all maladies Of ghastly spasm , or racking torture , qualms Of heart - sick agony , all feverous kinds , Convulsions , epilepsies , fierce catarrhs , Intestine stone and ulcer , colick - pangs , Demoniack phrenzy , moaping melancholy , And moon - struck	s
madness , pining atrophy , Marasmus , and wide - wasting pestilence , Dropsies , and asthmas , and joint - racking rheums . Dire was the tossing , deep the groans ; Despair Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch ; And over them triumphant Death his dart Shook , but delayed to strike , though oft invoked With vows , as their chief good , and final hope . Sight so deform what heart of rock could long Dry - eyed behold ? Adam could not , but wept , Though not of woman born ; compassion quelled His best of man , and gave him up to tears A space , till firmer thoughts restrained excess ; And , scarce recovering words , his plaint renewed . O miserable mankind , to what fall Degraded , to what wretched state reserved ! Better end here unborn . Why is life given To be thus wrested from us ? rather , why Obtruded on us thus ? who , if we knew What we receive , would either no accept Life offered , or soon beg to lay it down ; Glad to be so dismissed in	l
moulds prepared ; from which he formed First his own tools ; then , what might else be wrought Fusil or graven in metal . After these , But on the hither side , a different sort From the high neighbouring hills , which was their seat , Down to the plain descended ; by their guise Just men they seemed , and all their study bent To worship God aright , and know his works Not hid ; nor those things last , which might preserve Freedom and peace to Men ; they on the plain Long had not	s
tenour of Man ' s woe Holds on the same , from Woman to begin . From Man ' s effeminate slackness it begins , Said the Angel , who should better hold his place By wisdom , and superiour gifts received . But now prepare thee for another scene . He looked , and saw wide territory spread Before him , towns , and rural works between ; Cities of men with lofty gates and towers , Concourse in arms , fierce faces threatening war , Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise ; Part wield their arms ,	s
part curb the foaming steed , Single or in array of battle ranged Both horse and foot , nor idly mustering stood ; One way a band select from forage drives A herd of beeves , fair oxen and fair kine , From a fat meadow ground ; or fleecy flock , Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain , Their booty ; scarce with life the shepherds fly , But call in aid , which makes a bloody fray ; With cruel tournament the squadrons join ; Where cattle pastured late , now scattered lies With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field , Deserted : Others to a city strong Lay siege , encamped ; by battery , scale , and mine , Assaulting ; others from the wall defend With dart and javelin , stones , and sulphurous fire ; On each hand slaughter , and gigantick deeds . In other part the sceptered heralds call To council , in the city - gates ; anon Gray - headed men and grave , with warriours mixed , Assemble , and harangues are heard ; but soon , In factious opposition ; till at last , Of middle	l
age one rising , eminent In wise deport , spake much of right and wrong , Of justice , or religion , truth , and peace , And judgement from above : him old and young Exploded , and had seized with violent hands , Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence Unseen amid the throng : so violence Proceeded , and oppression , and sword - law , Through all the plain , and refuge none was found . Adam was all in tears , and to his guide Lamenting turned full sad ; O ! what are	s
and the climes of bliss , Exempt from death ; to show thee what reward Awaits the good ; the rest what punishment ; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold . He looked , and saw the face of things quite changed ; The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar ; All now was turned to jollity and game , To luxury and riot , feast and dance ; Marrying or prostituting , as befel , Rape or adultery , where passing fair Allured them ; thence from cups to civil broils . At length a reverend sire among them came , And of their doings great dislike declared , And testified against their ways ; he oft Frequented their assemblies , whereso met , Triumphs or festivals ; and to them preached Conversion and repentance , as to souls In prison , under judgements imminent : But all in vain : which when he saw , he ceased Contending , and removed his tents far off ; Then , from the mountain hewing timber tall , Began to build a vessel of huge bulk ; Measured by cubit , length , and breadth , and	l
Shall leave them to enjoy ; for the earth shall bear More than enough , that temperance may be tried : So all shall turn degenerate , all depraved ; Justice and temperance , truth and faith , forgot ; One man except , the only son of light In a dark age , against example good , Against allurement , custom , and a world Offended : fearless of reproach and scorn , The grand - child , with twelve sons encreased , departs From Canaan , to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile ; See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea : To sojourn in that land He comes , invited by a younger son In time of dearth ; a son , whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that realm Of Pharaoh : There he dies , and leaves his race Growing into a nation , and now grown Suspected to a sequent king , who seeks To stop their overgrowth , as inmate guests Or violence , he of their wicked ways Shall them admonish ; and before them set The paths	l
raven flies , And after him , the surer messenger , A dove sent forth once and again to spy Green tree or ground , whereon his foot may light : The second time returning , in his bill An olive - leaf he brings , pacifick sign : Anon dry ground appears , and from his ark The ancient sire descends , with all his train ; Then with uplifted hands , and eyes devout , Grateful to Heaven , over his head beholds A dewy cloud , and in the cloud a bow Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay , Betokening peace from God , and covenant new . Whereat the heart of Adam , erst so sad , Greatly rejoiced ; and thus his joy broke forth . O thou , who future things canst represent As present , heavenly Instructer ! I revive At this last sight ; assured that Man shall live , With all the creatures , and their seed preserve . Far less I now lament for one whole world Of wicked sons destroyed , than I rejoice For one man found so perfect , and so just , That God vouchsafes to	l
raise another world From him , and all his anger to forget . But say , what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven Distended , as the brow of God appeased ? Or serve they , as a flowery verge , to bind The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud , Lest it again dissolve , and shower the earth ? To whom the Arch - Angel . Dextrously thou aimest ; So willingly doth God remit his ire , Though late repenting him of Man depraved ; Grieved at his heart , when looking down he saw The	s
no dividual being : Reason in man obscured , or not obeyed , Immediately inordinate desires , And upstart passions , catch the government From reason ; and to servitude reduce Man , till then free . Therefore , since he permits Within himself unworthy powers to reign Over free reason , God , in judgement just , Subjects him from without to violent lords ; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom : Tyranny must be ; Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse . Yet sometimes nations will decline so low From virtue , which is reason , that no wrong , But justice , and some fatal curse annexed , Deprives them of their outward liberty ; Their inward lost : Witness the irreverent son Of him who built the ark ; who , for the shame Done to his father , heard this heavy curse , Servant of servants , on his vicious race . Thus will this latter , as the former world , Still tend from bad to worse ; till God at last , Wearied with their iniquities , withdraw His presence from among them , and avert His holy eyes ;	l
resolving from thenceforth To leave them to their own polluted ways ; And one peculiar nation to select From all the rest , of whom to be invoked , A nation from one faithful man to spring : Him on this side Euphrates yet residing , Bred up in idol - worship : O , that men ( Canst thou believe ?) should be so stupid grown , While yet the patriarch lived , who ' scaped the flood , As to forsake the living God , and fall To worship their own work in wood and stone For Gods	s
! Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes To call by vision , from his father ' s house , His kindred , and false Gods , into a land Which he will show him ; and from him will raise A mighty nation ; and upon him shower His benediction so , that in his seed All nations shall be blest : he straight obeys ; Not knowing to what land , yet firm believes : I see him , but thou canst not , with what faith He leaves his Gods , his friends , and native soil , Ur of Chaldaea , passing now the ford To Haran ; after him a cumbrous train Of herds and flocks , and numerous servitude ; Not wandering poor , but trusting all his wealth With God , who called him , in a land unknown . Canaan he now attains ; I see his tents Pitched about Sechem , and the neighbouring plain Of Moreh ; there by promise he receives Gift to his progeny of all that land , From Hameth northward to the Desart south ; ( Things by their names I call , though yet unnamed	l
Canaan from the shore advance Through the wild Desart , not the readiest way ; Lest , entering on the Canaanite alarmed , War terrify them inexpert , and fear Return them back to Egypt , choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude ; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untrained in arms , where rashness leads not on . This also shall they gain by their delay In the wide wilderness ; there they shall found Their government , and their great senate choose Through the twelve tribes , to rule by laws ordained : God from the mount of Sinai , whose gray top Shall tremble , he descending , will himself In thunder , lightning , and loud trumpets ' sound , Ordain them laws ; part , such as appertain To civil justice ; part , religious rites Of sacrifice ; informing them , by types And shadows , of that destined Seed to bruise The Serpent , by what means he shall achieve Mankind ' s deliverance . But the voice of God To mortal ear is dreadful : They beseech That Moses might report to them his will , And terrour cease	l
various laws are given ; So many laws argue so many sins Among them ; how can God with such reside ? To whom thus Michael . Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them , as of thee begot ; And therefore was law given them , to evince Their natural pravity , by stirring up Sin against law to fight : that when they see Law can discover sin , but not remove , Save by those shadowy expiations weak , The blood of bulls and goats , they may conclude Some blood more precious must be paid for Man ; Just for unjust ; that , in such righteousness To them by faith imputed , they may find Justification towards God , and peace Of conscience ; which the law by ceremonies Cannot appease ; nor Man the mortal part Perform ; and , not performing , cannot live . So law appears imperfect ; and but given With purpose to resign them , in full time , Up to a better covenant ; disciplined From shadowy types to truth ; from flesh to spirit ; From imposition of strict laws to free Acceptance of large	l
, but when sins National interrupt their publick peace , Provoking God to raise them enemies ; From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first , then under Kings ; of whom The second , both for piety renowned And puissant deeds , a promise shall receive Irrevocable , that his regal throne For ever shall endure ; the like shall sing All Prophecy , that of the royal stock Of David ( so I name this king ) shall rise A Son , the Woman ' s seed to thee foretold , Foretold to Abraham , as in whom shall trust All nations ; and to kings foretold , of kings The last ; for of his reign shall be no end . But first , a long succession must ensue ; And his next son , for wealth and wisdom famed , The clouded ark of God , till then in tents Wandering , shall in a glorious temple enshrine . Such follow him , as shall be registered Part good , part bad ; of bad the longer scroll ; Whose foul idolatries , and other faults Heaped to the popular sum , will	l
days . So spake the Arch - Angel Michael ; then paused , As at the world ' s great period ; and our sire , Replete with joy and wonder , thus replied . O Goodness infinite , Goodness immense ! That all this good of evil shall produce , And evil turn to good ; more wonderful Than that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness ! Full of doubt I stand , Whether I should repent me now of sin By me done , and occasioned ; or rejoice Much more , that much	s
, Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord ; Last , in the clouds , from Heaven to be revealed In glory of the Father , to dissolve Satan with his perverted world ; then raise From the conflagrant mass , purged and refined , New Heavens , new Earth , ages of endless date , Founded in righteousness , and peace , and love ; To bring forth fruits , joy and eternal bliss . He ended ; and thus Adam last replied . How soon hath thy prediction , Seer blest , Measured this transient world , the race of time , Till time stand fixed ! Beyond is all abyss , Eternity , whose end no eye can reach . Greatly - instructed I shall hence depart ; Greatly in peace of thought ; and have my fill Of knowledge , what this vessel can contain ; Beyond which was my folly to aspire . Henceforth I learn , that to obey is best , And love with fear the only God ; to walk As in his presence ; ever to observe His providence ; and on him sole depend , Merciful over all his	l
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard ; Chiefly what may concern her faith to know , The great deliverance by her seed to come ( For by the Woman ' s seed ) on all mankind : That ye may live , which will be many days , Both in one faith unanimous , though sad , With cause , for evils past ; yet much more cheered With meditation on the happy end . He ended , and they both descend the hill ; Descended , Adam to the bower , where Eve Lay sleeping ,	s
ground Gliding meteorous , as evening - mist Risen from a river o ' er the marish glides , And gathers ground fast at the labourer ' s heel Homeward returning . High in front advanced , The brandished sword of God before them blazed , Fierce as a comet ; which with torrid heat , And vapour as the Libyan air adust , Began to parch that temperate clime ; whereat In either hand the hastening Angel caught Our lingering parents , and to the eastern gate Led them direct , and down the cliff as fast To the	s
subjected plain ; then disappeared . They , looking back , all the eastern side beheld Of Paradise , so late their happy seat , Waved over by that flaming brand ; the gate With dreadful faces thronged , and fiery arms : Some natural tears they dropt , but wiped them soon ; The world was all before them , where to choose Their place of rest , and Providence their guide : They , hand in hand , with wandering steps and slow , Through Eden took their solitary way .

I will this Night , In seuerall Hands , in at his Windowes throw , As if they came from seuerall Citizens , Writings , all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his Name : wherein obscurely Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at . And after this , let Caesar seat him sure , For wee will shake him , or worse dayes endure . Enter . Thunder , and Lightning . Enter Caska , and Cicero . Cic .

Hor . That can I , At least the whisper goes so : Our last King , Whose Image euen but now appear ' d to vs , Was ( as you know ) by Fortinbras of Norway , ( Thereto prick ' d on by a most emulate Pride ) Dar ' d to the Combate . In which , our Valiant Hamlet , ( For so this side of our knowne world esteem ' d him ) Did slay this Fortinbras : who by a Seal ' d Compact , Well ratified by Law , and Heraldrie , Did forfeite ( with his life ) all those his Lands Which he stood seiz ' d on , to the Conqueror : Against the which , a Moity competent Was gaged by our King : which had	l

Thinke it no more : For nature cressant does not grow alone , In thewes and Bulke : but as his Temple waxes , The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule Growes wide withall . Perhaps he loues you now , And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch The vertue of his feare : but you must feare His greatnesse weigh ' d , his will is not his owne ; For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth : Hee may not , as vnuallued persons doe , Carue for himselfe ; for , on his choyce depends The sanctity and health of the whole State . And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib ' d Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body , Whereof he is the Head . Then if he sayes he loues you , It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it ; As he in his peculiar Sect and force May giue his saying deed : which is no further , Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall .

Beleeue me , I cannot Ham . I do beseech you Guild . I know no touch of it , my Lord Ham . ' Tis as easie as lying : gouerne these Ventiges with your finger and thumbe , giue it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most excellent Musicke . Looke you , these are the stoppes Guild . But these cannot I command to any vtterance of hermony , I haue not the skill Ham . Why looke you now , how vnworthy a thing you make of me : you would play vpon mee ; you would seeme	l
; the Queene would speak with you , and presently Ham . Do you see that Clowd ? that ' s almost in shape like a Camell Polon . By ' th ' Masse , and it ' s like a Camell indeed Ham . Me thinkes it is like a Weazell Polon . It is back ' d like a Weazell Ham . Or like a Whale ? Polon . Verie like a Whale Ham . Then will I come to my Mother , by and by : They foole me to the top of my bent . I will come by and by Polon . I will say so . Enter . Ham . By and by , is easily said . Leaue me Friends : ' Tis now the verie witching time of night , When Churchyards yawne , and Hell it selfe breaths out Contagion to this world . Now could I drink hot blood , And do such bitter businesse as the day Would quake to looke on . Soft now , to my Mother : Oh Heart , loose not thy Nature ; let not euer The Soule of Nero , enter this firme	l
: You go not till I set you vp a glasse , Where you may see the inmost part of you ? Qu . What wilt thou do ? thou wilt not murther me ? Helpe , helpe , hoa Pol . What hoa , helpe , helpe , helpe Ham . How now , a Rat ? dead for a Ducate , dead Pol . Oh I am slaine . Killes Polonius Qu . Oh me , what hast thou done ? Ham . Nay I know not , is it the King ? Qu . Oh what a rash , and bloody deed is this ? Ham . A bloody deed , almost as bad good Mother , As kill a King , and marrie with his Brother Qu . As kill a King ? Ham . I Lady , ' twas my word . Thou wretched , rash , intruding foole farewell , I tooke thee for thy Betters , take thy Fortune , Thou find ' st to be too busie , is some danger . Leaue wringing of your hands , peace , sit you downe , And let me wring your heart , for	l
workes . Speake to her Hamlet Ham . How is it with you Lady ? Qu . Alas , how is ' t with you ? That you bend your eye on vacancie , And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse . Forth at your eyes , your spirits wildely peepe , And as the sleeping Soldiours in th ' Alarme , Your bedded haire , like life in excrements , Start vp , and stand an end . Oh gentle Sonne , Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle coole patience . Whereon do you looke ? Ham . On him , on him : look you how pale he glares , His forme and cause conioyn ' d , preaching to stones , Would make them capeable . Do not looke vpon me , Least with this pitteous action you conuert My sterne effects : then what I haue to do , Will want true colour ; teares perchance for blood Qu . To who do you speake this ? Ham . Do you see nothing there ? Qu . Nothing at all , yet all that is I see Ham . Nor did you	l
nothing heare ? Qu . No , nothing but our selues Ham . Why look you there : looke how it steals away : My Father in his habite , as he liued , Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall . Enter . Qu . This is the very coynage of your Braine , This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in Ham . Extasie ? My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time , And makes as healthfull Musicke . It is not madnesse That I haue vttered ; bring me to the Test And	s
. I must to England , you know that ? Qu . Alacke I had forgot : ' Tis so concluded on Ham . This man shall set me packing : Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome , Mother goodnight . Indeede this Counsellor Is now most still , most secret , and most graue , Who was in life , a foolish prating Knaue . Come sir , to draw toward an end with you . Good night Mother . Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius . Enter King . King . There ' s matters in these	s
last swallowed , when he needes what you haue glean ' d , it is but squeezing you , and Spundge you shall be dry againe Rosin . I vnderstand you not my Lord Ham . I am glad of it : a knauish speech sleepes in a foolish eare Rosin . My Lord , you must tell vs where the body is , and go with vs to the King Ham . The body is with the King , but the King is not with the body . The King , is a thing - Guild . A thing my Lord ? Ham . Of nothing : bring me to him , hide Fox , and all after . Exeunt . Enter King . King . I haue sent to seeke him , and to find the bodie : How dangerous is it that this man goes loose : Yet must not we put the strong Law on him : Hee ' s loued of the distracted multitude , Who like not in their iudgement , but their eyes : And where ' tis so , th ' Offenders scourge is weigh ' d But neerer the offence :	l
but come , for England . Farewell deere Mother King . Thy louing Father Hamlet Hamlet . My Mother : Father and Mother is man and wife : man & wife is one flesh , and so my mother . Come , for England . Exit King . Follow him at foote , Tempt him with speed aboord : Delay it not , Ile haue him hence to night . Away , for euery thing is Seal ' d and done That else leanes on th ' Affaire , pray you make hast . And England , if my loue thou holdst at ought , As my great power thereof may giue thee sense , Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red After the Danish Sword , and thy free awe Payes homage to vs ; thou maist not coldly set Our Soueraigne Processe , which imports at full By Letters coniuring to that effect The present death of Hamlet . Do it England , For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages , And thou must cure me : Till I know ' tis done , How ere my happes , my ioyes were ne ' re	l

Hee mad confession of you , And gaue you such a Masterly report , For Art and exercise in your defence ; And for your Rapier most especiall , That he cryed out , t ' would be a sight indeed , If one could match you Sir . This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy , That he could nothing doe but wish and begge , Your sodaine comming ore to play with him ; Now out of this Laer . Why out of this , my Lord ? Kin . Laertes was your Father deare to you ? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart ? Laer . Why aske you this ? Kin . Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father , But that I know Loue is begun by Time : And that I see in passages of proofe , Time qualifies the sparke and	l
fire of it : Hamlet comes backe : what would you vndertake , To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed , More then in words ? Laer . To cut his throat i ' th ' Church Kin . No place indeed should murder Sancturize ; Reuenge should haue no bounds : but good Laertes Will you doe this , keepe close within your Chamber , Hamlet return ' d , shall know you are come home : Wee ' l put on those shall praise your excellence , And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman	s

A Pickhaxe and a Spade , a Spade , for and a shrowding - Sheete : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete Ham . There ' s another : why might not that bee the Scull of a Lawyer ? where be his Quiddits now ? his Quillets ? his Cases ? his Tenures , and his Tricks ? why doe ' s he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about the Sconce with a dirty Shouell , and will not tell him of his Action of Battery ? hum . This fellow might be in ' s time a great buyer of Land , with his Statutes , his Recognizances	l
Parchment made of Sheep - skinnes ? Hor . I my Lord , and of Calue - skinnes too Ham . They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance in that . I will speake to this fellow : whose Graue ' s this Sir ? Clo . Mine Sir : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete Ham . I thinke it be thine indeed : for thou liest in ' t Clo . You lye out on ' t Sir , and therefore it is not yours : for my part , I doe not lye in ' t ; and yet it is mine Ham . Thou dost lye in ' t , to be in ' t and say ' tis thine : ' tis for the dead , not for the quicke , therefore thou lyest Clo . ' Tis a quicke lye Sir , ' twill away againe from me to you Ham . What man dost thou digge it for ? Clo . For no man Sir Ham . What woman then ? Clo . For none neither Ham . Who is to	l

A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue , a pour ' d a Flaggon of Renish on my head once . This same Scull Sir , this same Scull sir , was Yoricks Scull , the Kings Iester Ham . This ? Clo . E ' ene that Ham . Let me see . Alas poore Yorick , I knew him Horatio , a fellow of infinite Iest ; of most excellent fancy , he hath borne me on his backe a thousand times : And how abhorred my Imagination is , my gorge rises at it . Heere hung those lipps , that I haue kist I know not how oft . Where be your Iibes now ? Your Gambals ? Your Songs ? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table on a Rore ? No one now to mock your own Ieering ? Quite chopfalne ? Now get	l
the Noble dust of Alexander , till he find it stopping a bunghole Hor . ' Twere to consider : to curiously to consider so Ham . No faith , not a iot . But to follow him thether with modestie enough , & likeliehood to lead it ; as thus . Alexander died : Alexander was buried : Alexander returneth into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make Lome , and why of that Lome ( whereto he was conuerted ) might they not stopp a Beere - barrell ? Imperiall Caesar , dead and turn ' d to clay , Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away . Oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , Should patch a Wall , t ' expell the winters flaw . But soft , but soft , aside ; heere comes the King . Enter King , Queene , Laertes , and a Coffin , with Lords attendant . The Queene , the Courtiers . Who is that they follow , And with such maimed rites ? This doth betoken , The Coarse they follow , did with disperate hand	l
indiscretion sometimes serues vs well , When our deare plots do paule , and that should teach vs , There ' s a Diuinity that shapes our ends , Rough - hew them how we will Hor . That is most certaine Ham . Vp from my Cabin My sea - gowne scarft about me in the darke , Grop ' d I to finde out them ; had my desire , Finger ' d their Packet , and in fine , withdrew To mine owne roome againe , making so bold , ( My feares forgetting manners ) to	s

Exceedingly , my Lord , it is very soultry , as ' twere I cannot tell how : but my Lord , his Maiesty bad me signifie to you , that he ha ' s laid a great wager on your head : Sir , this is the matter Ham . I beseech you remember Osr . Nay , in good faith , for mine ease in good faith : Sir , you are not ignorant	s
, do ' s wrong Laertes , Then Hamlet does it not , Hamlet denies it : Who does it then ? His Madnesse ? If ' t be so , Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong ' d , His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy . Sir , in this Audience , Let my disclaiming from a purpos ' d euill , Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts , That I haue shot mine Arrow o ' re the house , And hurt my Mother Laer . I am satisfied in Nature , Whose	s

Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table : If Hamlet giue the first , or second hit , Or quit in answer of the third exchange , Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire , The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath , And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw Richer then that	s

If thou did ' st euer hold me in thy heart , Absent thee from felicitie awhile , And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine , To tell my Storie . March afarre off , and shout within .

All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Glamis 2 . All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Cawdor 3 . All haile Macbeth , that shalt be King hereafter Banq . Good Sir , why doe you start , and seeme to feare Things that doe sound so faire ? i ' th ' name of truth Are ye fantasticall , or that indeed Which outwardly ye shew ? My Noble Partner You greet with present Grace , and great prediction Of Noble hauing , and of Royall hope , That he seemes wrapt withall : to me you speake not . If you can looke into the Seedes of Time , And say , which Graine will grow , and which will not , Speake then to me , who neyther begge , nor feare Your fauors , nor your hate 1 . Hayle 2 . Hayle 3 . Hayle 1 . Lesser than Macbeth , and	l

What , can the Deuill speake true ? Macb . The Thane of Cawdor liues : Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes ? Ang . Who was the Thane , liues yet , But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life , Which he deserues to loose . Whether he was combin ' d with those of Norway , Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe , And vantage ; or that with both he labour ' d In his Countreyes wracke , I know not : But Treasons Capitall , confess ' d , and prou ' d , Haue ouerthrowne him Macb . Glamys , and Thane of Cawdor : The greatest is behinde . Thankes for your paines . Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings , When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me , Promis ' d no lesse to them Banq . That trusted home	l
Liege , they are not yet come back . But I haue spoke with one that saw him die : Who did report , that very frankly hee Confess ' d his Treasons , implor ' d your Highnesse Pardon , And set forth a deepe Repentance : Nothing in his Life became him , Like the leauing it . Hee dy ' de , As one that had beene studied in his death , To throw away the dearest thing he ow ' d , As ' twere a carelesse Trifle King . There ' s no Art , To finde the Mindes construction in the Face . He was a Gentleman , on whom I built An absolute Trust . Enter Macbeth , Banquo , Rosse , and Angus . O worthyest Cousin , The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now Was heauie on me . Thou art so farre before , That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow , To ouertake thee . Would thou hadst lesse deseru ' d , That the proportion both of thanks , and payment , Might haue beene mine : onely I haue left to say , More is thy due	l

Your Highnesse part , is to receiue our Duties : And our Duties are to your Throne , and State , Children , and Seruants ; which doe but what they should , By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue And Honor King . Welcome hither : I haue begun to plant thee , and will labour To make thee full of growing . Noble Banquo , That hast no lesse deseru '	s
make thick my blood , Stop vp th ' accesse , and passage to Remorse , That no compunctious visitings of Nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keepe peace betweene Th ' effect , and hit . Come to my Womans Brests , And take my Milke for Gall , you murth ' ring Ministers , Where - euer , in your sightlesse substances , You wait on Natures Mischiefe . Come thick Night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell , That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes , Nor Heauen peepe	s
Buttrice , nor Coigne of Vantage , but this Bird Hath made his pendant Bed , and procreant Cradle , Where they must breed , and haunt : I haue obseru ' d The ayre is delicate . Enter Lady . King . See , see our honor ' d Hostesse : The Loue that followes vs , sometime is our trouble , Which still we thanke as Loue . Herein I teach you , How you shall bid God - eyld vs for your paines , And thanke vs for your trouble Lady . All our seruice , In euery point twice done , and then done double , Were poore , and single Businesse , to contend Against those Honors deepe , and broad , Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House : For those of old , and the late Dignities , Heap ' d vp to them , we rest your Ermites King . Where ' s the Thane of Cawdor ? We courst him at the heeles , and had a purpose To be his Purueyor : But he rides well , And his great Loue ( sharpe as his Spurre ) hath holp him To	l
his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet - tongu ' d against The deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like a naked New - borne - Babe , Striding the blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors ' d Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre , Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne the winde . I haue no Spurre To pricke the sides of my intent , but onely Vaulting Ambition , which ore - leapes it selfe , And falles on th ' other . Enter	s
to my consent , When ' tis , it shall make Honor for you Banq . So I lose none , In seeking to augment it , but still keepe My Bosome franchis ' d , and Allegeance cleare , I shall be counsail ' d Macb . Good repose the while Banq . Thankes Sir : the like to you . Exit Banquo . Macb . Goe bid thy Mistresse , when my drinke is ready , She strike vpon the Bell . Get thee to bed . Enter . Is this a Dagger , which I see before me , The Handle toward my Hand ? Come , let me clutch thee : I haue thee not , and yet I see thee still . Art thou not fatall Vision , sensible To feeling , as to sight ? or art thou but A Dagger of the Minde , a false Creation , Proceeding from the heat - oppressed Braine ? I see thee yet , in forme as palpable , As this which now I draw . Thou marshall ' st me the way that I was going , And such an Instrument I was to vse	l
When they did say God blesse vs Lady . Consider it not so deepely Mac . But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen ? I had most need of Blessing , and Amen stuck in my throat Lady . These deeds must not be thought After these wayes : so , it will make vs mad Macb .

Macd . Why see you not ? Ross . Is ' t known who did this more then bloody deed ? Macd . Those that Macbeth hath slaine Ross . Alas the day , What good could they pretend ? Macd . They were subborned , Malcolme , and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes Are stolne away and fled , which puts vpon them Suspition of the deed Rosse . ' Gainst Nature still , Thriftlesse Ambition , that will rauen vp Thine owne liues meanes : Then ' tis most like , The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth Macd . He is already nam ' d , and gone to Scone To be inuested Rosse . Where is Duncans body ? Macd . Carried to Colmekill , The Sacred Store - house of his Predecessors , And Guardian of their Bones Rosse . Will you to Scone ? Macd . No Cosin , Ile to Fife Rosse . Well , I will thither Macd . Well may you see things wel done there : Adieu Least our old Robes sit easier then our new Rosse . Farewell , Father Old M . Gods benyson go with you , and	l

Rather then so , come Fate into the Lyst , And champion me to th ' vtterance . Who ' s there ? Enter Seruant , and two Murtherers . Now goe to the Doore , and stay there till we call . Exit Seruant . Was it not yesterday we spoke together ? Murth . It was , so please your Highnesse Macb . Well then , Now haue you consider ' d of my speeches : Know , that it was he , in the times past , Which held you so vnder fortune , Which you thought had been our innocent selfe . This I made good to you , in our last conference , Past in probation with you : How you were borne in hand ,	l
how crost : The Instruments : who wrought with them : And all things else , that might To halfe a Soule , and to a Notion craz ' d , Say , Thus did Banquo 1 . Murth . You made it knowne to vs Macb . I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . Doe you finde your patience so predominant , In your nature , that you can let this goe ? Are you so Gospell ' d , to pray for this good man , And for	s

And I another , So wearie with Disasters , tugg ' d with Fortune , That I would set my Life on any Chance , To mend it , or be rid on ' t Macb . Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie Murth . True , my Lord Macb .	s
So is he mine : and in such bloody distance , That euery minute of his being , thrusts Against my neer ' st of Life : and though I could With bare - fac ' d power sweepe him from my sight , And bid my will auouch it ; yet I must not , For certaine friends that are both his , and mine , Whose loues I may not drop , but wayle his fall , Who I my selfe struck downe : and thence it is , That I to your assistance doe make loue , Masking the Businesse from the common Eye , For sundry weightie Reasons 2 . Murth . We shall , my Lord , Performe what you command vs 1 . Murth . Though our Liues - Macb . Your Spirits shine through you . Within this houre , at most , I will aduise you where to plant your selues , Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o ' th ' time , The moment on ' t , for ' t must be done to Night , And something from the Pallace : alwayes thought , That I require a	l

Where our desire is got without content : ' Tis safer , to be that which we destroy , Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy . Enter Macbeth . How now , my Lord , why doe you keepe alone ? Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making , Vsing those Thoughts , which should indeed haue dy ' d With them they thinke on : things without all remedie Should be without regard : what ' s done , is done Macb . We haue scorch ' d the Snake , not kill ' d it : Shee ' le close , and be her selfe , whilest our poore Mallice Remaines in danger of her former Tooth . But let the frame of things dis -	l

Duncane is in his Graue : After Lifes fitfull Feuer , he sleepes well , Treason ha ' s done his worst : nor Steele , nor Poyson , Mallice domestique , forraine Leuie , nothing ,	s

Thankes for that : There the growne Serpent lyes , the worme that ' s fled Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed , No teeth for th ' present . Get thee gone , to morrow Wee ' l heare our selues againe . Exit Murderer . Lady . My Royall Lord , You do not giue the Cheere , the Feast is sold That is not often vouch ' d , while ' tis a making : ' Tis giuen , with welcome : to feede were best at home : From thence , the sawce to meate is Ceremony , Meeting were bare without it .

And which is worse , all you haue done Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne , Spightfull , and wrathfull , who ( as others do ) Loues for his owne ends , not for you . But make amends now : Get you gon	s

My former Speeches , Haue but hit your Thoughts Which can interpret farther : Onely I say Things haue bin strangely borne .

Poore pratler , how thou talk ' st ? Enter a Messenger . Mes .

Better Macbeth , Then such an one to reigne Macd . Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is a Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne , And fall of many Kings .

Diuellish Macbeth , By many of these traines , hath sought to win me Into his power : and modest Wisedome pluckes me From ouer - credulous hast : but God aboue Deale betweene thee and me ; For euen now I put my selfe to thy Direction , and Vnspeake mine owne detraction . Heere abiure The taints , and blames I laide vpon my selfe , For strangers to my Nature . I am yet Vnknowne to Woman , neuer was forsworne , Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne . At no time broke my Faith , would not betray The Deuill to his Fellow , and delight No lesse in truth then life . My first false speaking Was this vpon my selfe . What I am truly Is thine , and my poore Countries to command : Whither indeed , before they heere approach Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point , was setting foorth : Now wee ' l together , and the chance of goodnesse Be like our warranted Quarrell .

Omnes ! omnes ! let others ignore what they may , I make the poem of evil also , I commemorate that part also , I am myself just as much evil as good , and my nation is -- and I say there is in fact no evil , ( Or if there is I say it is just as important to you , to the land or to me , as any thing else .)

The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside , I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile , Through the swung half - door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak , And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him , And brought water and fill ' d a tub for his sweated body and bruis ' d feet , And gave him a room that enter ' d from my own , and gave him	s

From the cinder - strew ' d threshold I follow their movements , The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms , Overhand the hammers swing , overhand so slow , overhand so sure , They do not hasten , each man hits in his place . 13 The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses , the block swags underneath on its tied - over chain , The negro that drives the long dray of the stone - yard , steady and tall he stands pois ' d on one leg on the string - piece , His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip - band , His glance is calm and commanding , he tosses the slouch of his	l
in the leafy shade , what is that you express in your eyes ? It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life . My tread scares the wood - drake and wood - duck on my distant and day - long ramble , They rise together , they slowly circle around . I believe in those wing ' d purposes , And acknowledge red , yellow , white , playing within me , And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional , And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else , And the in the woods never studied the gamut , yet trills pretty well to me , And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me . 14 The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night , Ya - honk he says , and sounds it down to me like an invitation , The pert may suppose it meaningless , but I listening close , Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky .

Prodigal , you have given me love -- therefore I to you give love ! O unspeakable passionate love . 22 You sea ! I resign myself to you also -- I guess what you mean , I behold from the beach your crooked fingers , I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me , We must have a turn together , I undress , hurry me out of sight of the land , Cushion me soft , rock me in billowy drowse , Dash me with amorous wet , I	l
make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them ?) I am not the poet of goodness only , I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also . What blurt is this about virtue and about vice ? Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me , I stand indifferent , My gait is no fault - finder ' s or rejecter ' s gait , I moisten the roots of all that has grown . Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy ? Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work ' d over and rectified ? I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance , Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine , Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start . This minute that comes to me over the past decillions , There is no better than it and now . What behaved well in the past or behaves well to - day is not such wonder , The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an	l

The earth by the sky staid with , the daily close of their junction , The heav ' d challenge from the east that moment over my head , The mocking taunt , See then whether you shall be master ! 25 Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun - rise would kill me , If I could not now and always send sun - rise out of me . We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun , We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak . My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach , With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds . Speech is the twin of my vision , it is unequal to measure itself , It provokes me forever , it says sarcastically , Walt you contain enough , why don ' t you let it out then ? Come now I will not be tantalized , you conceive too much of articulation , Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded ? Waiting in gloom , protected by frost , The dirt receding	l
lost my wits , I and nobody else am the greatest traitor , I went myself first to the headland , my own hands carried me there . You villain touch ! what are you doing ? my breath is tight in its throat , Unclench your floodgates , you are too much for me . 29 Blind loving wrestling touch , sheath ' d hooded sharp - tooth ' d touch ! Did it make you ache so , leaving me ? Parting track ' d by arriving , perpetual payment of perpetual loan , Rich showering rain ,	s
is no less than the journey work of the stars , And the pismire is equally perfect , and a grain of sand , and the egg of the wren , And the tree - toad is a chef - d ' oeuvre for the highest , And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven , And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery , And the cow crunching with depress ' d head surpasses any statue , And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels . I find I incorporate	s
of base - ball , At he - festivals , with blackguard gibes , ironical license , bull - dances , drinking , laughter , At the cider - mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash , sucking the juice through a straw , At apple - peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find , At musters , beach - parties , friendly bees , huskings , house - raisings ; Where the mocking - bird sounds his delicious gurgles , cackles , screams , weeps , Where the hay - rick stands in the barn - yard , where the dry - stalks are scatter ' d , where the brood - cow waits in the hovel , Where the bull advances to do his masculine work , where the stud to the mare , where the cock is treading the hen , Where the heifers browse , where geese nip their food with short jerks , Where sun - down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie , Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near , Where the humming - bird shimmers , where the	l
nose on the thick plate glass , Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn ' d up to the clouds , or down a lane or along the beach , My right and left arms round the sides of two friends , and I in the middle ; Coming home with the silent and dark - cheek ' d bush - boy , ( behind me he rides at the drape of the day ,) Far from the settlements studying the print of animals ' feet , or the moccasin print , By the cot in the hospital reaching	s
bayonets or batter ' d with the blunts of muskets , A youth not seventeen years old seiz ' d his assassin till two more came to release him , The three were all torn and cover ' d with the boy ' s blood . At eleven o ' clock began the burning of the bodies ; That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men . 35 Would you hear of an old - time sea - fight ? Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars ? List to the yarn , as my grandmother ' s father the sailor told it to me . Our foe was no sulk in his ship I tell you , ( said he ,) His was the surly English pluck , and there is no tougher or truer , and never was , and never will be ; Along the lower ' d eve he came horribly raking us . We closed with him , the yards entangled , the cannon touch ' d , My captain lash ' d fast with his own hands . We had receiv	l
doors they crowd ! I am possess ' d ! Embody all presences outlaw ' d or suffering , See myself in prison shaped like another man , And feel the dull unintermitted pain . For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch , It is I let out in the morning and barr ' d at night . Not a mutineer walks handcuff ' d to jail but I am handcuff ' d to him and walk by his side , ( I am less the jolly one there , and more the silent one	s
waiting for civilization , or past it and mastering it ? Is he some Southwesterner rais ' d out - doors ? is he Kanadian ? Is he from the Mississippi country ? Iowa , Oregon , California ? The mountains ? prairie - life , bush - life ? or sailor from the sea ? Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him , They desire he should like them , touch them , speak to them , stay with them . Behavior lawless as snow - flakes , words simple as grass , uncomb ' d head , laughter , and naivete , Slow - stepping feet , common features , common modes and emanations , They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers , They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath , they fly out of the glance of his eyes . 40 Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask -- lie over ! You light surfaces only , I force surfaces and depths also . Earth ! you seem to look for something at my hands , Say , old top - knot , what	l

Sleep -- I and they keep guard all night , Not doubt , not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you , I have embraced you , and henceforth possess you to myself , And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so . 41 I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs , And for strong	s

of mine . Ever the hard unsunk ground , Ever the eaters and drinkers , ever the upward and downward sun , ever the air and the ceaseless tides , Ever myself and my neighbors , refreshing , wicked , real , Ever the old inexplicable query , ever that thorn ' d thumb , that breath of itches and thirsts , Ever the vexer ' s hoot ! hoot ! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth , Ever love , ever the sobbing liquid of life , Ever the bandage under the chin , ever the trestles of death . Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking , To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning , Tickets buying , taking , selling , but in to the feast never once going , Many sweating , ploughing , thrashing , and then the chaff for payment receiving , A few idly owning , and they the wheat continually claiming . This is the city and I am one of the citizens , Whatever interests the rest interests me , politics , wars , markets , newspapers , schools	l
Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less , And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself . Not words of routine this song of mine , But abruptly to question , to leap beyond yet nearer bring ; This printed and bound book -- but the printer and the printing - office boy ? The well - taken photographs -- but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms ? The black ship mail ' d with iron , her mighty guns in her turrets -- but the pluck of the captain and engineers ? In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture -- but the host and hostess , and the look out of their eyes ? The sky up there -- yet here or next door , or across the way ? The saints and sages in history -- but you yourself ? Sermons , creeds , theology -- but the fathomless human brain , And what is reason ? and what is love ? and what is life ? 43 I do not despise you priests , all time , the world over , My faith is the greatest	l
bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers , I take my place among you as much as among any , The past is the push of you , me , all , precisely the same , And what is yet untried and afterward is for you , me , all , precisely the same . I do not know what is untried and afterward , But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient , and cannot fail . Each who passes is consider ' d , each who stops is consider ' d , not single one can	s
it fall . It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried , Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side , Nor the little child that peep ' d in at the door , and then drew back and was never seen again , Nor the old man who has lived without purpose , and feels it with bitterness worse than gall , Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder , Nor the numberless slaughter ' d and wreck ' d , nor the brutish koboo call ' d the ordure of humanity , Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in , Nor any thing in the earth , or down in the oldest graves of the earth , Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres , nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them , Nor the present , nor the least wisp that is known . 44 It is time to explain myself -- let us stand up . What is known I strip away , I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown	l
jealous upon me , All has been gentle with me , I keep no account with lamentation , ( What have I to do with lamentation ?) I am an acme of things accomplish ' d , and I an encloser of things to be . My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs , On every step bunches of ages , and larger bunches between the steps , All below duly travel ' d , and still I mount and mount . Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me , Afar down I see the huge first Nothing , I know I was even there , I waited unseen and always , and slept through the lethargic mist , And took my time , and took no hurt from the fetid carbon . Long I was hugg ' d close -- long and long . Immense have been the preparations for me , Faithful and friendly the arms that have help ' d me . Cycles ferried my cradle , rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen , For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings , They sent influences to look after	l
- push ' d elasticity ! O manhood , balanced , florid and full . My lovers suffocate me , Crowding my lips , thick in the pores of my skin , Jostling me through streets and public halls , coming naked to me at night , Crying by day , Ahoy ! from the rocks of the river , swinging and chirping over my head , Calling my name from flower - beds , vines , tangled underbrush , Lighting on every moment of my life , Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses , Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine . Old age superbly rising ! O welcome , ineffable grace of dying days ! Every condition promulges not only itself , it promulges what grows after and out of itself , And the dark hush promulges as much as any . I open my scuttle at night and see the far - sprinkled systems , And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems . Wider and wider they spread , expanding , always expanding , Outward and outward and	l
hasten forth , Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go . If you tire , give me both burdens , and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip , And in due time you shall repay the same service to me , For after we start we never lie by again . This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look ' d at the crowded heaven , And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs , and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them , shall we be fill ' d and satisfied then ? And my spirit said No , we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond . You are also asking me questions and I hear you , I answer that I cannot answer , you must find out for yourself . Sit a while dear son , Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink , But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes , I kiss you with a good - by kiss and open the gate for your egress	l
boat , ( It is you talking just as much as myself , I act as the tongue of you , Tied in your mouth , in mine it begins to be loosen ' d .) I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house , And I swear I will never translate myself at all , only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air . If you would understand me go to the heights or water - shore , The nearest gnat is an explanation , and a drop	s
or motion of waves key , The maul , the oar , the hand - saw , second my words . No shutter ' d room or school can commune with me , But roughs and little children better than they . The young mechanic is closest to me , he knows me well , The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day , The farm - boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice , In vessels that sail my words sail , I go with fishermen and seamen and love them . The soldier camp ' d or upon the march is mine , On the night ere the pending battle many seek me , and I do not fail them , On that solemn night ( it may be their last ) those that know me seek me . My face rubs to the hunter ' s face when he lies down alone in his blanket , The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon , The young mother and old mother comprehend me , The girl and	l

Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves ? And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead ? And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul ? And if the body were not the soul , what is the soul ? 2 The love of the body of	l

; O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale your faint odor , but I believe a few will ; O slender leaves ! O blossoms of my blood ! I permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you , O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves , you are not happiness , You are often more bitter than I can bear , you burn and sting me , Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots , you make me think of death , Death is beautiful from you , ( what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love ?) O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers , I think it must be for death , For how calm , how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers , Death or life I am then indifferent , my soul declines to prefer , ( I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most ,) Indeed O death , I think now these leaves	l
mean precisely the same as you mean , Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see ! grow up out of my breast ! Spring away from the conceal ' d heart there ! Do not fold yourself so in your pink - tinged roots timid leaves ! Do not remain down there so ashamed , herbage of my breast ! Come I am determin ' d to unbare this broad breast of mine , I have long enough stifled and choked ; Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you , now you serve me not , I will	s
say what I have to say by itself , I will sound myself and comrades only , I will never again utter a call only their call , I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States , I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will through the States , Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating , Give me your tone therefore O death , that I may accord with it , Give me yourself , for I see that you belong to me now above all , and are folded inseparably together , you love and death are , Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life , For now it is convey ' d to me that you are the purports essential , That you hide in these shifting forms of life , for reasons , and that they are mainly for you , That you beyond them come forth to remain , the real reality , That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait , no matter how long , That you will one day perhaps take	l
eternally . But these leaves conning you con at peril , For these leaves and me you will not understand , They will elude you at first and still more afterward , I will certainly elude you . Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me , behold ! Already you see I have escaped from you . For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book , Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it , Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me , Nor will the candidates for my love ( unless at most a very few ) prove victorious , Nor will my poems do good only , they will do just as much evil , perhaps more , For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit , that which I hinted at ; Therefore release me and depart on your way . } For You , O Democracy Come , I will make the continent indissoluble , I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon ,	l
these are curiously answer ' d by my lovers , my dear friends , When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me by the hand , When the subtle air , the impalpable , the sense that words and reason hold not , surround us and pervade us , Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom , I am silent , I require nothing further , I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity beyond the grave , But I walk or sit indifferent , I am satisfied , He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me . } The Base of All Metaphysics And now gentlemen , A word I give to remain in your memories and minds , As base and finale too for all metaphysics .

summer in the sound of the sea , And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather , Over the hoarse surging of the sea , Or flitting from brier to brier by day , I saw , I heard at intervals the remaining one , the he - bird , The solitary guest from Alabama .

For I , that was a child , my tongue ' s use sleeping , now I have heard you , Now in a moment I know what I am for , I awake , And already a thousand singers , a thousand songs , clearer , louder and more sorrowful than yours , A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me , never to die .

Of sea - captains young or old , and the mates , and of all intrepid sailors , Of the few , very choice , taciturn , whom fate can never surprise nor death dismay . Pick ' d sparingly without noise by thee old ocean , chosen by thee , Thou sea that pickest and cullest the race in time , and unitest nations , Suckled by thee , old husky nurse , embodying thee ,	l

The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see ! Phantoms ! phantoms countless by flank and rear ! Cock ' d hats of mothy mould -- crutches made of mist ! Arms in slings -- old men leaning on young men ' s shoulders . What troubles you Yankee phantoms ? what is all this chattering of bare gums ? Does the ague convulse your	s
you liars , mark ! Not for numberless agonies , murders , lusts , For court thieving in its manifold mean forms , worming from his simplicity the poor man ' s wages , For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh ' d at in the breaking , Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge , or the heads of the nobles fall ; The People scorn ' d the ferocity of kings .

drawn sigh , long , long I gazed , Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands , Passing sweet hours , immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade -- not a tear , not a word , Vigil of silence , love and death , vigil for you my son and my soldier , As onward silently stars aloft , eastward new ones upward stole , Vigil final for you brave boy , ( I could not save you , swift was your death , I faithfully loved you and cared for you living , I think we shall surely meet again ,) Till at latest lingering of the night , indeed just as the dawn appear ' d , My comrade I wrapt in his blanket , envelop ' d well his form , Folded the blanket well , tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet , And there and then and bathed by the rising sun , my son in his grave , in his rude - dug grave I deposited , Ending my vigil strange with that , vigil of night and battle - field	l
, postures beyond description , most in obscurity , some of them dead , Surgeons operating , attendants holding lights , the smell of ether , odor of blood , The crowd , O the crowd of the bloody forms , the yard outside also fill ' d , Some on the bare ground , some on planks or stretchers , some in the death - spasm sweating , An occasional scream or cry , the doctor ' s shouted orders or calls , The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches , These I	s
, or under the roof ' d hospital , To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return , To each and all one after another I draw near , not one do I miss , An attendant follows holding a tray , he carries a refuse pail , Soon to be fill ' d with clotted rags and blood , emptied , and fill ' d again . I onward go , I stop , With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds , I am firm with each , the pangs are sharp	s
yet unavoidable , One turns to me his appealing eyes -- poor boy ! I never knew you , Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you , if that would save you . 3 On , on I go , ( open doors of time ! open hospital doors !) The crush ' d head I dress , ( poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away ,) The neck of the cavalry - man with the bullet through and through examine , Hard the breathing rattles , quite glazed already the eye , yet life struggles hard , ( Come sweet death ! be persuaded O beautiful death ! In mercy come quickly .) From the stump of the arm , the amputated hand , I undo the clotted lint , remove the slough , wash off the matter and blood , Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv ' d neck and side falling head , His eyes are closed , his face is pale , he dares not look on the bloody stump , And has not yet look ' d on it . I dress a wound in	l
and more I dress with impassive hand , ( yet deep in my breast a fire , a burning flame .) 4 Thus in silence in dreams ' projections , Returning , resuming , I thread my way through the hospitals , The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand , I sit by the restless all the dark night , some are so young , Some suffer so much , I recall the experience sweet and sad , ( Many a soldier ' s loving arms about this neck have cross ' d and rested , Many a soldier ' s kiss dwells on these bearded lips .) } Long , Too Long America Long , too long America , Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn ' d from joys and prosperity only , But now , ah now , to learn from crises of anguish , advancing , grappling with direst fate and recoiling not , And now to conceive and show to the world what your children en - masse really are , ( For who except myself has yet conceiv ' d what your children en - masse really are ?) } Give	l

Give me interminable eyes -- give me women -- give me comrades and lovers by the thousand ! Let me see new ones every day	s
of muskets , ( even the sight of the wounded ,) Manhattan crowds , with their turbulent musical chorus ! Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me . } Dirge for Two Veterans The last sunbeam Lightly falls from the finish ' d Sabbath , On the pavement here , and there beyond it is looking , Down a new - made double grave .

} When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom ' d 1 When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom ' d , And the great star early droop ' d in the western sky in the night , I mourn ' d , and yet shall mourn with ever - returning spring . Ever - returning spring , trinity sure to me you bring , Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west , And thought of him I love . 2 O powerful western fallen star ! O shades of night -- O moody , tearful night ! O great star disappear ' d -- O the black murk that hides the star ! O cruel hands that hold me powerless -- O helpless soul of me ! O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul . 3 In the dooryard fronting an old farm - house near the white - wash ' d palings , Stands the lilac - bush tall - growing with heart - shaped leaves of rich green , With many a pointed blossom rising delicate , with the perfume strong I love , With every leaf a miracle -- and from this	l
coffin , and the sombre faces , With dirges through the night , with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn , With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour ' d around the coffin , The dim - lit churches and the shuddering organs -- where amid these you journey , With the tolling tolling bells ' perpetual clang , Here , coffin that slowly passes , I give you my sprig of lilac . 7 ( Nor for you , for one alone , Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring , For fresh as	s
of the afternoon swift passing , and the voices of children and women , The many - moving sea - tides , and I saw the ships how they sail ' d , And the summer approaching with richness , and the fields all busy with labor , And the infinite separate houses , how they all went on , each with its meals and minutia of daily usages , And the streets how their throbbings throbb ' d , and the cities pent -- lo , then and there , Falling upon them all and among them all , enveloping me with the rest , Appear ' d the cloud , appear ' d the long black trail , And I knew death , its thought , and the sacred knowledge of death . Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me , And the thought of death close - walking the other side of me , And I in the middle as with companions , and as holding the hands of companions , I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not , Down to the shores of the water , the	l
not feel my arm , he has no pulse nor will , The ship is anchor ' d safe and sound , its voyage closed and done , From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won ; Exult O shores , and ring O bells ! But I with mournful tread , Walk the deck my Captain lies , Fallen cold and dead . } Hush ' d Be the Camps To - Day [ May 4 , 1865 ] Hush ' d be the camps to - day , And soldiers let us drape our war	s
reject none , accept all , then reproduce all in my own forms . A breed whose proof is in time and deeds , What we are we are , nativity is answer enough to objections , We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded , We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves , We are executive in ourselves , we are sufficient in the variety of ourselves , We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves , We stand self - pois ' d in the middle , branching thence over the world , From Missouri , Nebraska , or Kansas , laughing attacks to scorn . Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves , Whatever appears , whatever does not appear , we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves only . ( O Mother -- O Sisters dear ! If we are lost , no victor else has destroy ' d us , It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night .) 3 Have you thought there could be but a single supreme ? There can be any number of supremes -- one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails	l
approaches , And that he shall be fittest for his days . Any period one nation must lead , One land must be the promise and reliance of the future . These States are the amplest poem , Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations , Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the day and night , Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars , Here are the roughs , beards , friendliness , combativeness , the soul loves , Here the flowing trains , here the crowds , equality , diversity , the soul loves . 6 Land of lands and bards to corroborate ! Of them standing among them , one lifts to the light a west - bred face , To him the hereditary countenance bequeath ' d both mother ' s and father ' s , His first parts substances , earth , water , animals , trees , Built of the common stock , having room for far and near , Used to dispense with other lands , incarnating this land , Attracting it body and soul to himself , hanging on	l
its neck with incomparable love , Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits , Making its cities , beginnings , events , diversities , wars , vocal in him , Making its rivers , lakes , bays , embouchure in him , Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes , Columbia , Niagara , Hudson , spending themselves lovingly in him , If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch , he stretching with them North or South , Spanning between them East and West , and touching whatever is between them , Growths growing from	s
sweep the world ! Ah Mother , prolific and full in all besides , yet how long barren , barren ?) 10 Of these States the poet is the equable man , Not in him but off from him things are grotesque , eccentric , fail of their full returns , Nothing out of its place is good , nothing in its place is bad , He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion , neither more nor less , He is the arbiter of the diverse , he is the key , He is the equalizer of his age and land , He supplies what wants supplying , he checks what wants checking , In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace , large , rich , thrifty , building populous towns , encouraging agriculture , arts , commerce , lighting the study of man , the soul , health , immortality , government , In war he is the best backer of the war , he fetches artillery as good as the engineer ' s , he can make every word he speaks draw blood , The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by	l
of skeletons , By the roadside others disdainfully toss ' d . 13 Rhymes and rhymers pass away , poems distill ' d from poems pass away , The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass , and leave ashes , Admirers , importers , obedient persons , make but the soil of literature , America justifies itself , give it time , no disguise can deceive it or conceal from it , it is impassive enough , Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them , If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them , there is no fear of mistake , ( The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr ' d till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb ' d it .) He masters whose spirit masters , he tastes sweetest who results sweetest in the long run , The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint ; In the need of songs , philosophy , an appropriate native grand - opera , shipcraft , any craft , He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical example .	l
Already a nonchalant breed , silently emerging , appears on the streets , People ' s lips salute only doers , lovers , satisfiers , positive knowers , There will shortly be no more priests , I say their work is done , Death is without emergencies here , but life is perpetual emergencies here , Are your body , days , manners , superb ? after death you shall be superb , Justice , health , self - esteem , clear the way with irresistible power ; How dare you place any thing before a man ? 14 Fall	s
many a dying soldier lean ' d to breathe his last , This arm , this hand , this voice , have nourish ' d , rais ' d , restored , To life recalling many a prostrate form ;) I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of myself , Rejecting none , permitting all . ( Say O Mother , have I not to your thought been faithful ? Have I not through life kept you and yours before me ?) 15 I swear I begin to see the meaning of these	s
for men and women , ( I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing love for men and women , After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and women .) in myself , I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself , ( Talk as you like , he only suits these States whose manners favor the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States .) Underneath the lessons of things , spirits , Nature , governments , ownerships , I swear I perceive other lessons	s
the arrogant blood of the brawn belov ' d of time . I am for those that have never been master ' d , For men and women whose tempers have never been master ' d , For those whom laws , theories , conventions , can never master . I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth , Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all . I will not be outfaced by irrational things , I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me , I will make cities and civilizations defer to	s

And I saw the free souls of poets , The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me , Strange large men , long unwaked , undisclosed , were disclosed to me . 20 O my rapt verse , my call , mock me not ! Not for the bards of the past , not to invoke them have I launch ' d you forth , Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario ' s shores , Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song . Bards for my own land only I invoke , ( For the war the war is over , the field is clear ' d ,) Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward , To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul .

object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day , Or for many years or stretching cycles of years . The early lilacs became part of this child , And grass and white and red morning - glories , and white and red clover , and the song of the phoebe - bird , And the Third - month lambs and the sow ' s pink - faint litter , and the mare ' s foal and the cow ' s calf , And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond - side , And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there , and the beautiful curious liquid , And the water - plants with their graceful flat heads , all became part of him . The field - sprouts of Fourth - month and Fifth - month became part of him , Winter - grain sprouts and those of the light - yellow corn , and the esculent roots of the garden , And the apple - trees cover ' d with blossoms and the fruit afterward , and wood - berries , and the commonest	l
soul , Unclaim ' d , avoided house -- take one breath from my tremulous lips , Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you , Dead house of love -- house of madness and sin , crumbled , crush ' d , House of life , erewhile talking and laughing -- but ah , poor house , dead even then , Months , years , an echoing , garnish ' d house -- but dead , dead , dead . } This Compost 1 Something startles me where I thought I was safest , I	s
withdraw from the still woods I loved , I will not go now on the pastures to walk , I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea , I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me . O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken ? How can you be alive you growths of spring ? How can you furnish health you blood of herbs , roots , orchards , grain ? Are they not continually putting distemper ' d corpses within you ? Is not every continent work ' d over and over with sour dead ? Where have you disposed of their carcasses ? Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations ? Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat ? I do not see any of it upon you to - day , or perhaps I am deceiv ' d , I will run a furrow with my plough , I will press my spade through the sod and turn it up underneath , I am sure I shall expose some of the foul	l
infused fetor , It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal , annual , sumptuous crops , It gives such divine materials to men , and accepts such leavings from them at last . } To a Foil ' d European Revolutionaire Courage yet , my brother or my sister ! Keep on -- Liberty is to be subserv ' d whatever occurs ; That is nothing that is quell ' d by one or two failures , or any number of failures , Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people , or by any unfaithfulness , Or the show of the tushes of power , soldiers , cannon , penal statutes . What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents , Invites no one , promises nothing , sits in calmness and light , is positive and composed , knows no discouragement , Waiting patiently , waiting its time .

thinks , is of consequence , Not a move can a man or woman make , that affects him or her in a day , month , any part of the direct lifetime , or the hour of death , But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime . The indirect is just as much as the direct , The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body , if not more . Not one word or deed , not venereal sore , discoloration , privacy of the onanist	s

of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name , date , location , All that was ever manfully begun , whether it succeeded or no , All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his mouth , or the shaping of his great hands , All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe , or on any of the wandering stars , or on any of the fix ' d stars , by those there as we are here , All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are , or by any one , These inure , have inured , shall inure , to the identities from which they sprang , or shall spring .

pulses stop for ecstasy and awe . 2 The sun was low in the west one winter day , When down a narrow aisle amid the thieves and outlaws of the land , ( There by the hundreds seated , sear - faced murderers , wily counterfeiters , Gather ' d to Sunday church in prison walls , the keepers round , Plenteous , well - armed , watching with vigilant eyes ,) Calmly a lady walk ' d holding a little innocent child by either hand , Whom seating on their stools beside her on the platform , She	s

My girl I appoint with you an appointment , and I charge you that you make preparation to be worthy to meet me , And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come . Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget me . } I Was Looking a Long While I was looking a long while for Intentions , For a clew to the history of the past for myself , and for these chants -- and now I have found it , It is not in those paged fables in the libraries , ( them I neither accept nor reject ,) It is no more in the legends than in all else , It is in the present -- it is this earth to - day , It is in Democracy --( the purport and aim of all the past ,) It is the life of one man or one woman to - day -- the average man of to - day , It is in languages , social customs , literatures , arts , It is in the broad	l
of space is a miracle , Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same , Every foot of the interior swarms with the same . To me the sea is a continual miracle , The fishes that swim -- the rocks -- the motion of the waves -- the ships with men in them , What stranger miracles are there ? } Sparkles from the Wheel Where the city ' s ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day , Withdrawn I join a group of children watching , I pause aside with them . By the curb toward the edge of the flagging , A knife - grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife , Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone , by foot and knee , With measur ' d tread he turns rapidly , as he presses with light but firm hand , Forth issue then in copious golden jets , Sparkles from the wheel . The scene and all its belongings , how they seize and affect me , The sad sharp - chinn ' d old man with worn clothes and broad shoulder - band	l
of the man ' s brain , duly obedient , Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded , Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy ; A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity , but every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman ; First the man is shaped in the woman , he can then be shaped in himself . } What Am I After All What am I after all but a child , pleas ' d with the sound of my own name ? repeating it over and over ; I stand apart to hear -- it never tires me . To you your name also ; Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in the sound of your name ? } Kosmos Who includes diversity and is Nature , Who is the amplitude of the earth , and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth , and the great charity of the earth , and the equilibrium also , Who has not look ' d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing , or	l
to another still . The great laws take and effuse without argument , I am of the same style , for I am their friend , I love them quits and quits , I do not halt and make salaams . I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of things , They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen . I cannot say to any person what I hear -- I cannot say it to myself -- it is very wonderful . It is no small matter , this round and delicious globe moving	s
, and never perhaps to see each other , is every bit as wonderful . And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful , And that I can remind you , and you think them and know them to be true , is just as wonderful . And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth , is equally wonderful , And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally wonderful . } Tests All submit to them where they sit , inner , secure , unapproachable to	s

so free , whistling across the prairies , Strong hum of forest tree - tops -- wind of the mountains , Personified dim shapes -- you hidden orchestras , You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert , Blending with Nature ' s rhythmus all the tongues of nations ; You chords left as by vast composers -- you choruses , You formless , free , religious dances -- you from the Orient , You undertone of rivers , roar of pouring cataracts , You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry , Echoes of camps with all the different bugle - calls , Trooping tumultuous , filling the midnight late , bending me powerless , Entering my lonesome slumber - chamber , why have you seiz ' d me ? 2 Come forward O my soul , and let the rest retire , Listen , lose not , it is toward thee they tend , Parting the midnight , entering my slumber - chamber , For thee they sing and dance O soul . A festival song , The duet of the bridegroom and the bride , a marriage - march , With lips of love , and hearts of	l
, And the sweet varied instruments , and the diapason of organs , And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death , I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumber - chamber , Come , for I have found the clew I sought so long , Let us go forth refresh ' d amid the day , Cheerfully tallying life , walking the world , the real , Nourish ' d henceforth by our celestial dream . And I said , moreover , Haply what thou hast heard O soul was	s
the teeming spiritual darkness , Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and countless stars above , Below , the manifold grass and waters , animals , mountains , trees , With inscrutable purpose , some hidden prophetic intention , Now first it seems my thought begins to span thee . Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating , Adam and Eve appear , then their myriad progeny after them , Wandering , yearning , curious , with restless explorations , With questionings , baffled , formless , feverish , with never - happy hearts , With that sad	s
incessant refrain , Wherefore unsatisfied soul ? and Whither O mocking life ? Ah who shall soothe these feverish children ? Who Justify these restless explorations ? Who speak the secret of impassive earth ? Who bind it to us ? what is this separate Nature so unnatural ? What is this earth to our affections ? ( unloving earth , without a throb to answer ours , Cold earth , the place of graves .) Yet soul be sure the first intent remains , and shall be carried out , Perhaps even now the time has arrived . After the seas are all cross ' d , ( as they seem already cross ' d ,) After the great captains and engineers have accomplish ' d their work , After the noble inventors , after the scientists , the chemist , the geologist , ethnologist , Finally shall come the poet worthy that name , The true son of God shall come singing his songs . Then not your deeds only O voyagers , O scientists and inventors , shall be justified , All these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth ' d , All affection shall	l
be fully responded to , the secret shall be told , All these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hook ' d and link ' d together , The whole earth , this cold , impassive , voiceless earth , shall be completely Justified , Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish ' d and compacted by the true son of God , the poet , ( He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains , He shall double the cape of Good Hope to some purpose ,) Nature and Man shall be disjoin ' d and	s

The mediaeval navigators rise before me , The world of 1492 , with its awaken ' d enterprise , Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth in spring , The sunset splendor of chivalry declining . And who art thou sad shade ? Gigantic , visionary , thyself a visionary , With majestic limbs and pious beaming eyes , Spreading around with every look of thine a golden world , Enhuing it with gorgeous hues . As the chief histrion , Down to the footlights walks in some great scena , Dominating the rest I see the Admiral himself , ( History ' s type of courage , action , faith ,) Behold him sail from Palos leading his little fleet , His voyage behold , his return , his great fame , His misfortunes , calumniators , behold him a prisoner , chain ' d , Behold his dejection , poverty , death .

Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect ?) Thou pulse -- thou motive of the stars , suns , systems , That , circling , move in order , safe , harmonious , Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space , How should I think , how breathe a single breath , how speak , if , out of myself , I could not launch , to those , superior universes ? Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God , At Nature and its wonders , Time and Space and Death , But that I , turning , call to thee O soul , thou actual Me , And lo , thou gently masterest the orbs , Thou matest Time , smilest content at Death , And fillest , swellest full the vastnesses of Space . Greater than stars or suns , Bounding O soul thou journeyest forth ; What love than thine and ours could wider amplify ? What aspirations , wishes , outvie thine	l
, as duly come from Thee . All my emprises have been fill ' d with Thee , My speculations , plans , begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee , Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee ; Intentions , purports , aspirations mine , leaving results to Thee . O I am sure they really came from Thee , The urge , the ardor , the unconquerable will , The potent , felt , interior command , stronger than words , A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep , These sped me on . By me and these the work so far accomplish ' d , By me earth ' s elder cloy ' d and stifled lands uncloy ' d , unloos ' d , By me the hemispheres rounded and tied , the unknown to the known . The end I know not , it is all in Thee , Or small or great I know not -- haply what broad fields , what lands , Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know , Transplanted there may rise to stature , knowledge worthy Thee , Haply the swords	l

The married couple sleep calmly in their bed , he with his palm on the hip of the wife , and she with her palm on the hip of the husband , The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed , The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs , And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt . The blind sleep , and the deaf and dumb sleep , The prisoner sleeps well in the prison , the runaway son sleeps , The murderer that is to be hung next day , how does he sleep ? And the murder ' d person , how does he sleep ? The female that loves unrequited sleeps , And the male that loves unrequited sleeps ,	l
Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together , Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on the old homestead . A red squaw came one breakfast - time to the old homestead , On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush - bottoming chairs , Her hair , straight , shiny , coarse , black , profuse , half - envelop ' d her face , Her step was free and elastic , and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke . My mother	s
I have dream ' d that the purpose and essence of the known life , the transient , Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life , the permanent . If all came but to ashes of dung , If maggots and rats ended us , then Alarum ! for we are betray ' d , Then indeed suspicion of death . Do you suspect death ? if I were to suspect death I should die now , Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well - suited toward annihilation ? Pleasantly and well - suited I walk , Whither I walk I cannot define , but I know it is good , The whole universe indicates that it is good , The past and the present indicate that it is good . How beautiful and perfect are the animals ! How perfect the earth , and the minutest thing upon it ! What is called good is perfect , and what is called bad is just as perfect , The vegetables and minerals are all perfect , and the imponderable fluids perfect ; Slowly and surely they have pass ' d on to this , and	l
slowly and surely they yet pass on . 9 I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul ! The trees have , rooted in the ground ! the weeds of the sea have ! the animals ! I swear I think there is nothing but immortality ! That the exquisite scheme is for it , and the nebulous float is for it , and the cohering is for it ! And all preparation is for it -- and identity is for it -- and life and materials are altogether for it ! [ BOOK	s

, unceasing , unbeginning , yet long untaught I did not hear , But now the chorus I hear and am elated , A tenor , strong , ascending with power and health , with glad notes of daybreak I hear , A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves , A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe , The triumphant tutti , the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and violins , all these I fill myself with , I hear not the volumes of sound merely , I am moved by the	s

A huge sob -- a few bubbles -- the white foam spirting up -- and then the women gone , Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on -- and I now pondering , Are those women indeed gone ? Are souls drown ' d and destroy ' d so ? Is only matter triumphant ? } The Last Invocation At the last , tenderly , From the walls of the powerful fortress ' d house , From the clasp of the knitted locks , from the keep of the well - closed doors , Let me be wafted . Let me glide noiselessly forth ; With the key of softness unlock the locks -- with a whisper , Set ope the doors O soul . Tenderly -- be not impatient , ( Strong is your hold O mortal flesh , Strong is your hold O love .) } As I Watch the Ploughman Ploughing As I watch ' d the ploughman ploughing , Or the sower sowing in the fields , or the harvester	l

humiliation of my race , it becomes all mine , Mine too the revenges of humanity , the wrongs of ages , baffled feuds and hatreds , Utter defeat upon me weighs -- all lost -- the foe victorious , ( Yet ' mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last , Endurance , resolution to the last .) 8 Now trumpeter for thy close , Vouchsafe a higher strain than any yet , Sing to my soul , renew its languishing faith and hope , Rouse up my slow belief , give me some vision of the future , Give me for once its prophecy and joy . O glad , exulting , culminating song ! A vigor more than earth ' s is in thy notes , Marches of victory -- man disenthral ' d -- the conqueror at last , Hymns to the universal God from universal man -- all joy ! A reborn race appears -- a perfect world , all joy ! Women and men in wisdom innocence and health -- all joy ! Riotous laughing bacchanals fill ' d with joy !

who has made hymns fit for the earth ? for I am mad with devouring ecstasy to make joyous hymns for the whole earth . } Ah Poverties , Wincings , and Sulky Retreats Ah poverties , wincings , and sulky retreats , Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me , ( For what is my life or any man ' s life but a conflict with foes , the old , the incessant war ?) You degradations , you tussle with passions and appetites , You smarts from dissatisfied friendships , ( ah wounds the sharpest of all !) You toil of painful and choked articulations , you meannesses , You shallow tongue - talks at tables , ( my tongue the shallowest of any ;) You broken resolutions , you racking angers , you smother ' d ennuis ! Ah think not you finally triumph , my real self has yet to come forth , It shall yet march forth o ' ermastering , till all lies beneath me , It shall yet stand up the soldier of ultimate victory . } Thoughts Of public opinion , Of a calm and cool fiat sooner or later	l

Of the frivolous Judge -- of the corrupt Congressman , Governor , Mayor -- of such as these standing helpless and exposed , Of the mumbling and screaming priest , ( soon , soon deserted ,) Of the lessening year by year of venerableness , and of the dicta of officers , statutes , pulpits , schools , Of the rising forever taller and stronger and broader of the intuitions of	s

Long yet your road , fateful flag -- long yet your road , and lined with bloody death , For the prize I see at issue at last is the world , All its ships and shores I see interwoven with your threads greedy banner ; Dream ' d again the flags of kings , highest borne to flaunt unrival ' d ?

Who walk ' d with kings with even pace the round world ' s promenade ; But that in foreign lands , in all thy walks with kings , Those prairie sovereigns of the West , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Ohio ' s , Indiana ' s millions , comrades , farmers , soldiers , all to the front , Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round world ' s promenade , Were all so justified . } Spirit That Form ' d This Scene [ Written in Platte Canyon , Colorado ] Spirit	s
that form ' d this scene , These tumbled rock - piles grim and red , These reckless heaven - ambitious peaks , These gorges , turbulent - clear streams , this naked freshness , These formless wild arrays , for reasons of their own , I know thee , savage spirit -- we have communed together , Mine too such wild arrays , for reasons of their own ; Wast charged against my chants they had forgotten art ? To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse ? The lyrist ' s measur ' d beat , the wrought - out temple ' s grace -- column and polish ' d arch forgot ?
